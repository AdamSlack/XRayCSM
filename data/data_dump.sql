17951	2595	4	3	Only two of 10 play areas are accessible with the free version. Paid areas look similar to free options, except for a small, opaque lock. When tapped, they hear the message "Meet your favorite animals with fun videos and activities!"  Tap the "More Apps" icon on the app's main screen and the developer's other apps appear.

17967	2597	6	3	Kids can practice addition, part-whole relationships, and critical thinking.\n
17968	2598	0	4	Game play is pretty straightforward, with tutorials in place to get players started. Decent variety in play. Harvesting DNA from dinosaurs feels more like a matter of skill than luck.\n
17969	2598	1	2	Battles between dinosaurs are bloodless but have a realistic look. Attacks include visual effects to represent things like slashes, shields, and more.\n
17970	2598	2	0	
17971	2598	3	0	
18041	2608	3	1	Rare use of "crap." Chat could expose players to inappropriate language.\n
18186	2629	1	1	While players do attack other characters, it's all done in a cartoony, card-on-card way.\n
17972	2598	4	2	Although there's an occasional push to watch an ad or spend money on a special deal, it's not forced on you. You can also buy extra resources or a sign up for monthly VIP subscription, but it's possible to play steadily without feeling you have to spend additional money.\n
17973	2598	5	0	
17974	2598	6	-1	
17975	2599	0	5	Play is a simple matter of following quest lines by placing items and starting actions. You have to manage things like inventory, available space, and finding components for certain items/quests, but it's pretty self-explanatory.\n
17976	2599	1	2	The Goosebumps franchise walks a balance between kid-friendliness and horror, offering spooky thrills but not outright terror. Gameplay follows suit, with monsters and scary tales but no blood or gore. The most graphic thing is a ghost kid walking around with his dismembered head.\n
17977	2599	2	0	
17978	2599	3	0	
17979	2599	4	5	Constantly pushes players to watch ads to earn small amounts of in-game currency or complete certain actions early. While it's possible to play without spending any real money, it's a long grind to earn any significant amount of premium currency, which is used for many actions and items, including special buildings and characters that can't be acquired any other way.\n
17980	2599	5	0	
17981	2599	6	-1	
17982	2600	0	5	Simple controls, easy to learn.\n
17983	2600	1	3	War among rival gangs is frequent with various firearms; blood spatter features in combat and in-menu graphics.\n
17984	2600	2	3	Women are scantily-clad mobster accessories; sex with them is implied with closed curtains and sound effects.\n
17985	2600	3	5	Frequent use of "whore," "asshole," "piss" in game dialogue. Unmonitored chat exposes players to worse comments from others.\n
17986	2600	4	5	Paid upgrades make for faster progress; developer pays players for five-star ratings.\n
17987	2600	5	3	Gameplay features casinos, clubs, alcohol, smoking frequently as activities characters engage in to make money or for their entertainment.\n
17988	2600	6	-1	
17989	2601	0	3	Easy point-and-shoot play complicated by clumsy controls and pay-to-win mechanics.\n
17990	2601	1	2	Combat's the point of the game, but robot-on-robot violence means no blood.\n
17991	2601	2	0	
17992	2601	3	0	
17993	2601	4	3	Progress more or less demands purchases with real money.\n

17999	2602	3	0	
18000	2602	4	1	Some of the meditations are sponsored by brands, and there's a link to donate to the non-profit behind the app.\n
18001	2602	5	0	
18002	2602	6	3	Kids can learn to focus on their breathing, body signals, and senses. They're also encouraged to think about friendships, building relationships, kindness, and other positive attributes. \n
18003	2603	0	5	Very easy to use.\n
18004	2603	1	3	Mention of suicide without details, but including historical justifications. \n
18005	2603	2	3	Mention of relationships and marriage that fall outside of today's societal norms. (i.e. polygamy and marrying siblings). \n
18006	2603	3	3	Lots of disrespectful language between the player and the character. Some negative comments about women.\n
18007	2603	4	4	The free version offers the chance to buy characters without a parent gate.\n
18008	2603	5	0	
18009	2603	6	2	Older kids who can filter out filler can learn a bit about historical figures and the cultures in which they lived.\n
18010	2604	0	4	Very easy to use. Clearly defined options. \n

18016	2604	6	3	Kids can learn about handling stress, mental health, making wise decisions, meditation.\n
18017	2605	0	3	Simple controls; players tap on key points to activate certain actions. Difficulty comes in some puzzle elements, which challenge players to be more observant and play around with a little trial and error to figure out what's required to move forward.\n

18023	2605	6	2	Inspired by artwork of artist Fritz Kahn, the game gives basic explanations for how the human body works by comparing it to a well-regulated factory, complete with workers responsible for its day-to-day operation (fun, if not biologically accurate).\n
18024	2606	0	4	Very easy to use. Must find and tap Kanopy Kids to access kid-friendly content.\n

18026	2606	2	0	
18027	2606	3	0	
18028	2606	4	1	Some popular kids series and brands featured in some videos and animated books.\n
18029	2606	5	0	
18030	2606	6	3	Depending on content individual users select, there's potential for cultural, language, social-emotional, and math learning, too, though mostly passive experiences.\n
18031	2607	0	3	Streamlined controls mean easy wins; complex upgrade system takes time to absorb.\n
18032	2607	1	3	Combat is near-constant, with cartoonish swords, guns, and energy weapons. No blood or gore.\n
18033	2607	2	3	Some female characters have cleavage and wear tight/revealing outfits. Reference to fetishes. Dialogue can be objectifying and can focus on characters' underwear or physical measurements.\n
18034	2607	3	1	In-game chat isn't moderated, possibly exposing players to inappropriate content.\n
18035	2607	4	1	The game is free to play, but store items are promoted/make purchases tempting.\n
18036	2607	5	0	
18037	2607	6	-1	
18038	2608	0	3	Auto-play button makes single player a breeze; online versus play takes know-how to succeed.\n
18039	2608	1	3	Constant bloodless cartoon violence with hand to hand weapons, magic abilities.\n
18040	2608	2	1	Some female characters shown in skimpy costumes.\n
18187	2629	2	0	
18042	2608	4	3	Slow progression to gain new powers, levels unless aided by purchases using real money. Watching ads gives you bonus items for play sessions.\n
18043	2608	5	0	
18044	2608	6	-1	
18045	2609	0	5	Even without the autoplay feature, the game essentially plays itself. Combat happens automatically, without much input from players other than placement of characters before a fight and activating special abilities when they're charged up.\n
18046	2609	1	3	Fighting is core to the gameplay, with teams fighting through waves of enemy troops. Players also can fight against each other's teams in the multiplayer Arena. Despite all the fighting, there's no blood or gore. Instead, defeated enemies/heroes are simply knocked out and disappear from the screen after collapsing to the ground.\n
18047	2609	2	0	
18048	2609	3	1	Although there are built-in filters in place, chat channels occasionally have toxic/offensive conversations.\n
18049	2609	4	5	Although the game is free to play, it heavily pushes players to spend money to make progress with things like diamonds (in-game currency), package deals that unlock new characters, and extended login bonuses. Each purchase also raises the user's "VIP" status, unlocking exclusive features and bonuses.\n
18050	2609	5	0	
18051	2609	6	-1	
18052	2610	0	2	Should walk a new player through a tutorial, but doesn't. You have to select it from the menu, and it doesn't cover everything you need to know about the cards. The iPad version is wonky and sometimes key buttons don't work.\n
18053	2610	1	0	
18054	2610	2	0	
18055	2610	3	0	
18056	2610	4	4	Multiplayer play requires a "token" that costs real money (10 are included free). There's no parent gate for the purchase. \n
18057	2610	5	0	
18058	2610	6	2	Kids can practice calculating area, arithmetic, and understanding different types of numbers (odd, even, prime, composite). The impact is lessened by subpar descriptions on the cards and little support when kids make mistakes.\n
18059	2611	0	3	Simple touch controls, but gameplay can be challenging to avoid crashes or land on your wheels after a jump.\n
18060	2611	1	0	While vehicles do crash, drivers don't suffer injuries, and no blood or gore is shown.\n
18061	2611	2	0	
18062	2611	3	0	
18063	2611	4	3	Players can earn in-game currency by playing, watching ads, or spending real money. This currency is then used to upgrade or customize vehicles. Players can also keep playing on tracks by watching ads.\n

18065	2611	6	-1	
18066	2612	0	5	Each activity is clearly explained the first time it's opened. Kids need to be able to tap and drag with precision for most games.\n

18069	2612	3	0	
18070	2612	4	1	Kids can tap to see icons for other apps from the same developer. They'll need to answer a simple arithmetic equation to view the app in the app store.\n
18071	2612	5	0	
18072	2612	6	3	Kids can work on some cognitive functions through simple games. Learning potential is limited, but kids must rely on short-term memory, observation, and quick reaction time. They'll also practice their fine motor skills.\n
18073	2613	0	5	Very easy to use. Step-by-step instructions. Clear visual icons. Emergency hotline numbers displayed prominently.\n

18092	2615	5	0	
18093	2615	6	3	Kids can practice fine motor skills by tapping and dragging objects around the screen. Some activities of light learning content, like putting puzzle pieces together to build toys or giving plants sun and water to grow. With the free play structure, kids have the chance to use their imaginations, experiment, and create stories about what they're doing.\n
18094	2616	0	3	Simple touch controls, but solving puzzles on some levels can be challenging.\n

20154	2910	2	0	Teens and other users can send and receive unmonitored photos, texts, and videos.\n
20155	2910	3	0	Teens and other users can send and receive unmonitored photos, texts, and videos.\n
20156	2910	4	3	Encourages users to invite friends and contacts to download the app and sign up for an account. There are only a few animated effects available; others are available for in-app purchase.\n
20157	2910	5	0	No content related to drinking, drugs, or smoking in the app itself, but teens can send and receive unmonitored photos.\n
20158	2910	6	0	Created for entertainment and not intended for learning.\n
20159	2911	0	5	Simple controls; easy to learn.\n
20160	2911	1	1	While you shoot enemy planes down and they occasionally explode, there's no human suffering shown. \n

20166	2912	0	4	Although younger kids may need help downloading or accessing books within the app, the rest of the tool is very straightforward and easy to use.\n
20167	2912	1	1	The app itself does not promote violence. However, the text that kids can access through LibriVox and Bookshare is not filtered by this tool and may contain potentially violent language. Adults should help kids select texts that best match their interests and levels.\n
20168	2912	2	1	The app itself does not promote sexual content. However, the text that kids can access through LibriVox and Bookshare is not filtered by this tool and may contain potentially suggestive language. Adults should help kids select texts that best match their interests and levels.\n
20169	2912	3	1	The app itself does not promote inappropriate language. However, the text kids can access through LibriVox and Bookshare is not filtered by this tool and may contain swear words or slurs. Adults should help kids select texts that best match their interests and levels.\n
20170	2912	4	3	Users need a Bookshare subscription or access to book files in a Daisy (pub) format.\n
20171	2912	5	-1	
20172	2912	6	3	By providing learners easy access to audio books, the potential educational impact of this tool is huge. However, without access to a Benetech Bookshare account, the value may be limited.\n
20173	2913	0	4	Navigating and reading the stories is very intuitive.\n
20174	2913	1	4	Many stories involve intense suspense and the threat of death and end dramatically with the implication of death.\n
20175	2913	2	5	Mature stories, those including graphic sex and violence, are allowed and easily found through searches. Images in story library include partial nudity.\n
20176	2913	3	4	No language filter for stories, so language ranges from mild insults to "f--k." \n
20177	2913	4	3	Readers can read a small, set amount each day without paying for a subscription but will have to pay to get unlimited access.\n
20178	2913	5	4	Rating guidelines don't address drinking, drugs, and smoking, and stories include underage substance use.\n
20179	2913	6	3	Stories don't have the depth of literary short stories or novels but are engaging enough to get teens reading. Teens can write and submit their own chat stories, too, giving them a chance to publish their writing.\n
20180	2914	0	3	While it's pretty easy to get started, the in-app instructions fly by and are a little hard to read. Plus, several features won't work reliably unless you pay for access.\n
20181	2914	1	2	It really depends on the day's content, but some in-app ads promote games with some animated violence and gore. \n
20182	2914	2	2	Depends on the day's news, but the app itself doesn't feature any racy content. \n
20183	2914	3	2	Most linked news stories come from professional news outlets where swearing isn't tolerated; however, some questions link to news sources that might be more free with obscene language. \n
20184	2914	4	3	Free version has ads after each quiz and a persistent ad along the bottom. Users have lots of options to buy "helpers" to get more hints during the quizzes. \n
20185	2914	5	2	Depends on the day's news stories, but no drinking, drugs, or smoking are promoted directly through the app. \n
20186	2914	6	3	With a little parental guidance, kids can practice reading and listen to news for the main details, and they can learn to think critically to pick out the most likely answer to each multiple-choice question about the news. Since each answer includes a link to a news story that was the source of the question, kids can start to get familiar with the news sources that are reliable and trustworthy. Kids can also get in the habit of reading whole news articles and deciding for themselves what's important. \n
20187	2915	0	4	Turn-based tap combat is easy; auto-combat is even more so.\n
20188	2915	1	5	As bloody, gruesome as it gets against human, zombie enemies. Characters shot, dismembered, stabbed during combat.\n
20189	2915	2	0	
20190	2915	3	5	Frequent use of "s--t," "f--k." All manner of language seen in in-game chat.\n
20191	2915	4	1	Purchases make things easier but aren't necessary.\n
20198	2916	4	4	Progressing without spending real money is very difficult. \n

20201	2917	0	3	Bit of a learning curve, and it's not always intuitive how to accomplish tasks (such as view the video feed of people in your room). Content gets stacked on top of content, and it's all a bit of a jumble. After some practice, pretty easy to quickly get to the point where you're watching videos or listening to music with friends. \n
20202	2917	1	3	Plenty of iffy content to search and share.\n
20203	2917	2	3	Plenty of iffy content to search and share.\n
20204	2917	3	3	Plenty of iffy content to search and share.\n
20205	2917	4	4	YouTube, Twitch, Spotify, and others have ads, plus additional ads provided by app's marketing partners.\n
20206	2917	5	3	Plenty of iffy content to search and share.\n
20207	2917	6	-1	
20208	2918	0	4	Some delayed prompting within the play areas, but kids will have little trouble figuring out what to do.\n

20213	2918	5	0	
20214	2918	6	2	While kids can talk about different vehicles and consider how you might use vehicles in different environments, none of this is explicit. And the activities aren't always realistic, so it's really more about fun and imagination. \n
20215	2919	0	2	Overall experience is a bit confusing. Not clear at first glance what you can do. Parts of the app say "coming soon." App crashes frequently. Videos and games don't always load properly.\n
20216	2919	1	4	Some of the available games include weapons and cartoon violence. \n
20217	2919	2	1	One game is a simulated chat between a girl and her boyfriend. Chat is fairly mild -- "I miss you," "I want to see you now. It's so lonely here..," "I wish I could cook for you now" -- but winning the game requires the girl saying just the right things to the boy. \n
20218	2919	3	0	
20219	2919	4	4	There are pop-up ads before every game you play (including replays). Some of the Grom accounts post products and product overview videos. Avatar customization includes premium content offers.\n
20220	2919	5	0	
20221	2919	6	1	Kids can start to learn about social media and how to interact with others online. Unfortunately, the broken parent controls and unstable app undermine some of that potential.\n
20222	2920	0	3	Using this app is mostly a passive experience: You interact with your device and it reports what you've been up to. Still, its simple interface does a nice job of giving limited feedback and helping teens see what they've been up to and what boundaries their parents have set. \n

20228	2920	6	3	Kids can start to see exactly how much time they spend on their devices and how much time they spend in each app. Kids can also get a nice on-screen reminder of how they've used their time and whether they've used it wisely. With some parental boundaries in place, kids can also start to get a sense of which sites are most worth their while.\n
20229	2921	0	3	Games can be tricky to figure out and aren't all consistent in ways to succeed.\n
20230	2921	1	3	Suggested death and cartoon-style violence. Grandma gets hit by a car, falls to ground, and an angel-like figure floats away. Option of giving a crying baby poison.\n

20235	2921	6	3	Rich variety of games helps kids develop social-emotional skills such as empathy, self-regulation, and conflict resolution. Kids may not make the connection from the gameplay to the concepts, though, and could benefit from a conversation about putting it all together.\n
20236	2922	0	4	Since parents have control over which items kids can use, most kids will have no trouble navigating the experience. \n
20237	2922	1	1	Parents have control over what kids can access, but some of the videos in the moderated video selection contain cartoon violence (no weapons, or silly weapons such as mind control) and mean behavior. There are also short-lived moments of peril, such as when a character is kidnapped by aliens. \n
20238	2922	2	0	
20239	2922	3	0	
20240	2922	4	1	Parents can control which aspects of the experience kids can use, but there is an "app store" parents can activate where kids can request the apps they want.\n
20241	2922	5	0	
20242	2922	6	0	While kids can use this app to access educational content, it does not provide an educational experience on its own.\n

20247	2923	4	4	The two free meditations are buried below the in-app purchase options. There's no parent gate, so if your kid taps on one of the in-app purchase meditation options, the app moves directly to the "buy" option.\n
20248	2923	5	0	
20249	2923	6	2	Kids can learn a bit about meditation, guided visualization, body scanning, and mindfulness. Through choosing programs for specific times and scenarios, kids can learn how calming supports can assist them in gaining focus, reducing anxiety, falling asleep more easily, and growing in confidence.\n
20250	2924	0	5	Few instructions on purpose so kids will figure out the next challenge. But gameplay is generally intuitive, and kids only need to be able to tap and drag.\n

20253	2924	3	0	
20254	2924	4	1	On the home screen, kids can see icons for other apps from the same developer. Seeing more requires passing through a parent gate. However, at the time of this review, all LumiKids apps are free.\n
20255	2924	5	0	
20256	2924	6	3	Kids can learn about fun things to do in the snow, such as slide around and throw snowballs. They'll get an introduction to letter names and practice tracing all 26 uppercase letters. And kids also will exercise some cognitive skills such as sustained attention, memory, and critical thinking.\n
20374	2941	5	0	
20257	2925	0	3	Simple controls mean a quick start; increasing difficulty demands good strategy. \n
20258	2925	1	2	Combat is everything, but it's non-graphic, bloodless. \n
20259	2925	2	1	Some female heroes wear sexy costumes, have flirty taglines. \n

20270	2926	6	4	Kids can learn how to identify and express emotions with their parent or caregiver's help. Through memorable songs, adorable videos, and useful conversation starters, a caring adult can help a preschooler learn emotional vocabulary, self-awareness, self-expression, and how to move beyond common obstacles in the lives of little ones. \n
20271	2927	0	4	Very easy to use. Select a meditation scene, tap play, listen.\n

20275	2927	4	3	Some meditations are free. Extended meditations are shown along with free versions but are available only via in-app purchase. There's an Other Apps tab within the app that promotes the developers' other apps that leads directly to the App Store when tapped.\n
20276	2927	5	0	
20277	2927	6	2	Kids can learn how using guided meditation can promote healthy calm and reduce stress. While this is not an educational app, using it to relax can help kids practice the skill of calming themselves with support.\n
20278	2928	0	3	Making a book is easy. But general app navigation isn't always intuitive, and new screens are often slow to load.\n

20284	2928	6	3	Kids can practice their reading  and writing skills by reading the ebooks submitted by other users and creating their own. The narrate option allows kids to practice reading out loud. Kids can express themselves when they choose a topic to write about and feel a sense of accomplishment when they see their book published in the public forum.\n
20285	2929	0	5	Kids easily tap and drag their way through a musical wonderland. It might take some practice to learn where kids can interact with the app and where they can't.\n

20291	2929	6	3	Kids can learn to recognize and appreciate some of the most well-known pieces of classical music, as well as learn about a variety of musical instruments and a bit about how music is structured. Parents who read the included learning guide can supplement kids' learning with information about the featured composers and instruments, and they can give names and meaning to the conceptual topics such as musical notes or treble and bass clef. Kids also can express their own creative musical sides as they explore the digital instruments.\n
20292	2930	0	4	Navigating the app is still not entirely smooth, but most kids in the target age range will have no trouble figuring it out. \n
20293	2930	1	3	Many of the stop-motion animation videos include Lego-on-Lego violence, including the use of weapons. This is similar to the line of video games in that there's no blood or gore.\n
20294	2930	2	0	
20295	2930	3	0	
20296	2930	4	3	While there are no banner ads or outside ads, the app basically serves as a giant Lego ad. In addition to the basic peer pressure that occurs as kids show off their collections, the app includes challenges that ask kids to build certain things, such as a pizza or a blue building. It also includes mentions of new products and videos that display specific Lego sets. Kids can't purchase from within the app.\n
20297	2930	5	1	Parents can expect there to be occasional pictures and videos that imply the use of alcohol.\n
20298	2930	6	2	Kids can get inspiration and the occasional set of directions to help them with their own builds. The challenges might encourage kids to be more creative rather than just to follow directions.\n
20299	2931	0	3	Kids can learn some beginning piano technique for both pop and classical music, from basic fingering technique to scales to chords. Also, kids can learn some basic musical notation: Whether they can read music or not, they can learn basic skills for reading a score and matching pitches and rhythm to what's shown on screen. An in-app progress tracker rewards kids for putting in practice time and trying new "quests," so kids can learn persistence and dedication if they use this app to stick to their practice goals.\n

20311	2932	5	0	
20312	2932	6	3	Kids can learn how to evaluate expressions and solve equations and inequalities, including fractions, integers, decimals, linear equations, and more. Each basic step of a solution is shown, which helps kids understand the process for solving a multistep problem. In the paid version, explanations are given for each step. Keep in mind that some kids will try to use the app as a "cheat sheet," so supervision may be needed.\n
20313	2933	0	3	Efficient tap-swipe controls plus strategic combat mean fun, challenging gameplay.\n
20314	2933	1	3	Combat is almost nonstop, wounded enemies have torn flesh. Heroes only vanish upon death. \n
20315	2933	2	2	Lots of mild adolescent talk about dating, marriage. Implied that heroes spend night together; some female heroes wear sexy outfits.\n
20316	2933	3	1	Some mild language such as "damn," "hell." \n
20317	2933	4	2	Purchase prompts appear on opening game but overall aren't too invasive. Players can progress without buying anything.\n

20333	2935	6	4	Kids can learn about space travel and growing plants under microgravity conditions. Although moving through the space station in "zero-g" is initially difficult, it's a great experience for kids and helps them understand one of the many challenges astronauts face. With video clips, educator guides, and lesson plans, kids can learn about zero gravity, plant growth, lunar travel, and conducting experiments as they manipulate variables.\n
20334	2936	0	4	Watching videos and doing the activities are easy and straightforward. Sometimes links and video playback don't work correctly.\n
20335	2936	1	2	Characters threaten violence, such as hitting, slapping, and pinching, and sometimes actually do hit, slap, or pinch.\n
20336	2936	2	1	In at least one video episode, there are scantily dressed women and a man who clearly demonstrates his attraction to them.\n
20337	2936	3	1	Mild name-calling using words such as "dumb" and "dummy."\n
20338	2936	4	0	
20339	2936	5	0	
20340	2936	6	2	Just by watching the videos and interacting with new vocabulary, kids can pick up a few new words in English. Much of the vocabulary is organized into useful categories and covers the classic basics of learning a new language such as colors, shapes, body parts, and animals.\n
20341	2937	0	4	The way kids must tap and drag things around is mostly intuitive, but kids may need a bit of trial-and-error experimentation since there are no instructions or hints.\n

20346	2937	5	0	
20347	2937	6	3	Kids can use their executive-functioning skills as they work to satisfy all their customers. Remembering each customer's order exercises their memory and matching skills. Kids can add a touch of personal flair when they decide which toppings or garnishes to add to each order. Mostly, kids will experience how hard it can be to keep up with everything in a busy café.\n
20348	2938	0	4	Very easy for kids to choose and play the videos. Simple parent controls allow parents to set screen-time limits and the kinds of videos played.\n

20353	2938	5	0	
20354	2938	6	3	Kids can learn some basic preschool- and kindergarten-level skills, as well as subject-specific skills (such as science experiments, origami, and yoga). Kids age 3 to 7 also can learn some basic practical life skills (hand washing, the importance of vitamins, and making crafts). There also are animated bios of famous people and lots of entertainment-based videos, some with social/emotional lessons and creative projects such as making crafts.\n
20355	2939	0	5	Simple controls; easy to learn.\n
20356	2939	1	3	Characters perform wrestling moves with punches, kicks, head-butts; they hit each other with objects like chairs, but no blood, gore.\n
20357	2939	2	0	
20358	2939	3	1	One character talks about opening a can of "whoop ass." Messages between players unmoderated but censored.\n
20359	2939	4	5	Real-world money can be used to buy playable characters, and in-game currency can be used to buy character upgrades. Numerous advertisements for real-world WWE events.\n
20360	2939	5	1	Nutritional supplements available in the game.\n
20361	2939	6	-1	
20362	2940	0	4	Mostly easy to play, once you follow the on-screen prompts. Also contains a helpful community of users who help newbies learn the ropes. Can be confusing to discern what awards are available via earning points and what you can buy via in-app purchase.\n
20363	2940	1	0	No violent content observed during this review. Content in chat is dependent on what users post.\n
20364	2940	2	0	No sexual content observed during this review. Content in chat is dependent on what users post.\n
20365	2940	3	0	No objectionable language observed during this review. Content in chat is dependent on what users post.\n
20366	2940	4	3	Regarding buying gems, the app says "supports the developers and helps keep Habitica running." But the idea of earning gems by keeping your habit and productivity promises to yourself seems negated by the option to buy the gems with real money via in-app purchases.\n
20367	2940	5	0	No drinking, drugs, or smoking references observed during this review. Content in chat is dependent on what users post. Common area of app is called the "Tavern."\n
20368	2940	6	3	Teens can learn about goal-setting and working to achieve goals. As they set the habits they want to develop within or remove from their lives, they can track behaviors daily and assess their own progress. Using the motivators on this app, they can put forth effort and persevere to earn points, develop new habits, and eliminate unhealthy or unwanted habits.\n
20369	2941	0	4	Simple to navigate; connects easily to Bookshare. The app includes an instruction manual, but many settings (voice, text speed, and so on) are controlled on the device and not within the app. \n

20375	2941	6	3	Although the app doesn't highlight individual words as they're read aloud, hesitant and struggling readers can benefit from seeing the text as it's being read. It also provides easier access to text-based learning experiences that kids may not otherwise be able to enjoy due to print disabilities.\n

20378	2942	2	5	While some nudity, visuals are more artsy and cartoony than erotic. Story elements include gender, identity.\n
20379	2942	3	5	Some characters use offensive, bigoted language that includes misogynistic, homophobic comments. Some infrequent, light profanity.\n

20411	2947	0	3	Kids can explore what tons of colleges have to offer. By browsing careers and majors, kids can start to explore the kinds of things they might study and the types of careers they might pursue when they get older. There's an outsize focus on the salaries people could earn from attending each school, which can be misleading, but this could be a helpful conversations starter about the different kinds of careers that people can choose based on what they study in college. \n

It walks kids through the basics of the story arc (setup, conflict, challenge, climax, and resolution), letting them choose their scenery and characters or draw their own from scratch and then record their own dialogue and choose appropriate music. With so many options for creativity, it allows kids to be creators instead of just consumers.\n

20761	2997	0	4	No tutorial, but game mechanics are easy to grasp. \n
20445	2951	6	3	Kids can learn and listen to a long list of classic songs and nursery rhymes. They can also practice sorting and other cognitive skills with games that require kids to recognize and match shape or color or to complete puzzles. With a large collection of activities, songs, and stories, kids can get some very basic practice with a variety of early learning and early literacy topics.\n
20446	2952	0	3	Simple controls, but puzzles get tougher as you progress.\n

20482	2957	1	3	You'll spend most of the game in a fight, using hands, a slingshot, a bat, and more, but there's no blood or gore. \n
20483	2957	2	3	Some kissing and suggestive language with options for opposite and same-sex relationships. \n

20494	2958	6	3	Kids get some light practice with a few early learning themes. They'll count to 10 and match quantity with number name and written numeral. As they take puppies in and out of the tub, they can also practice with counting in ascending and descending order. Kids have to recognize and match shape and color to sort and choose the right items. And kids can get creative and express their musical sides with the puppy piano.\n
20495	2959	0	4	Very easy to use. Dot leads kids through all of the app's options with audio suggestions and directions. Clear icons also give visual cues.\n

20500	2959	5	0	
20501	2959	6	4	Kids can learn about a variety of subjects including the basics of how to use and add information to a wiki-like collaborative information source. Kids use multiple forms of expression -- visual, audio, and written -- to gather and share information with others. As users make the effort to complete daily quests and add their own articles (or add to existing articles), they are producing new multimedia content, making wise decisions, and using subject-specific vocabulary to share information.\n
20502	2960	0	4	Navigation is sometimes a bit awkward and requires good fine motor skills, but overall, games are easy and accessible.\n

20508	2960	6	5	Teach Your Monster to Read's goal is to teach your kid to read -- and it's got a pretty good chance of doing just that. Kids can start from the very beginning and learn to match letters to the sounds they make. Higher levels introduce more concepts such as phonemes, letter combinations, sound-them-out words, sight words, and finally full sentences. There's a lot here to guide kids through the sometimes-complex process of learning to read.\n
20509	2961	0	5	Kids will have no trouble navigating this experience.\n
20510	2961	1	1	Lots of trash-talking and an enemy who is constantly plotting to ruin your rap career. \n
20511	2961	2	2	There are references to dating and having crushes. Characters wear revealing clothing with lots of cleavage.\n
20513	2961	4	4	Some focus on materialism. You are expected to buy new clothing and hair styles along the way to meet a "style" requirement that gives bonuses for each task. Expect pressure for in-app purchases, either for the coolest clothes (which require a premium in-game currency) or for energy to complete tasks more quickly. Ads (full-screen) are prevalent but can be removed with any purchase.\n
20514	2961	5	2	Activities often take place in locations with bars. There are alcohol-related tasks that can't be avoided (i.e., "Drink Champagne").\n
20515	2961	6	0	Created for entertainment and not intended for learning.\n
20516	2962	0	3	It's great that you can control your movements with or without a VR viewer. There's quite a bit of reading to figure out what to do, but gameplay is pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.\n

20522	2962	6	3	While kids might learn the names of some key organelles within the cell, there's not much baked in to help kids learn about how viruses work or how cells function. Still, the great visuals and fun gameplay may inspire kids to learn more.\n
20523	2963	0	3	Kids may need some help starting out, especially for those who are using Google Cardboard rather then the View-Master device. Directions say to "Push down on lever," which simply means to push the button on the Google Cardboard (or tap the screen on the device). The activities are easy enough to follow, but the directions require a lot of reading. Some menu icons aren't clear. \n
20524	2963	1	3	No violence, but a moment where a shark comes into the enclosure and snaps at you. Paired with the 3D nature of the experience, some kids might find this upsetting.\n

20536	2964	6	3	Limited content, but what's available can be a great introduction to new places, sites, or information. The immersive experience is likely to grab kids' attention in a way that simple 2D coverage can't. Kids may be inspired to learn more about what they see, then come back to visit these faraway places again.\n
20537	2965	0	4	Easy to play. Just swipe to move the hearts or stars around Casey's head as it spins. Make sure the hearts or stars don't touch. Spinning speeds up as you play. More than 1,000 levels.\n

The app's developer clearly states its goal for its clients, including Casey Simpson: "What are we good at? Making you money!" Coins can be purchased in-app for $0.99 to $2.99. Banner ads can be removed for $1.99. No parent gate.\n

20564	2968	6	3	With this open-ended creative platform, kids have free reign to experiment and express themselves. Kids can try on an endless number of hairstyles, colors, types, and more. They'll use their imaginations to create realistic or totally crazy looks as they discover what their own preferences are. And they'll make decisions about what tools to use to create different effects.\n
20565	2969	0	4	By design, there are no instructions. Some kids may be confused about what to do to get started, even with the prompts.\n

They'll have to save up to earn new items and make decisions about their priorities. It's not ideal for kids who are just learning to add or subtract, unless an adult is helping out.\n
20572	2970	0	3	A basic tutorial walks users through how to swipe left and right, and it insists on making you follow the developers as an example.\n
20573	2970	1	0	The terms of service prohibit images of violence or images that might incite violence, but user-generated content could contain violence.\n
20574	2970	2	3	Despite terms of service that specify that photos cannot be sexual in nature, many photos are sexually explicit. Plus, Yellow is based on Tinder, which connects people based solely on location and whether people "like" each other's appearance. Tinder is reportedly known for being used as a hookup site for sex, and it's possible that Yellow users might use Yellow for the same purposes.\n
20575	2970	3	0	Though most of the app's content is images, not text, some users' profiles include bad language, and other user-generated content could contain profanity.\n

Kids can also learn how augmented reality technology is applied in the app. Through investigating what they see on this app, kids can gain cultural understanding about the way the White House plays important roles in American governance. \n
20593	2973	0	4	There are no rules, and it's super easy to explore and navigate. Sometimes it can be awkward to place objects where you want them or difficult to pick up small objects.\n

20599	2973	6	3	Kids are empowered to take charge of their play experience and invent as many situations as they can. They'll practice storytelling and try on different personas as they set scenes, create characters, and craft stories. Kids can also practice virtual animal care by cleaning up after the horses, feeding and grooming them, and letting them out for exercise.\n
20600	2974	0	4	The game is deliberately hard to play -- that's the whole shtick. Instructions never mean what you think they mean, buttons don't always work the way they should, and the interface changes in unexpected ways. Most of the time, it's all part of the joke, but occasionally these tricks cause more frustration than they do gameplay satisfaction. \n

20604	2974	4	4	In-app purchase reminders pop up every few levels or so, and timed in-game currency gifts keep players hungry for more. Coins can only be spent on puzzle hints and solutions, many of which can be found online with a quick search, but there's no good way to avoid advertisements. If you answer a level incorrectly five times, the game offers the choice to buy your way back in or go back three levels. \n
20605	2974	5	0	
20606	2974	6	2	Offers some divergent thinking practice, requiring players to read instructions critically and break the traditional "rules" of mobile games, but there's little evidence that these kinds of puzzles actually translate their wacky outside-the-box experiences to real-world problem-solving.\n
20607	2975	0	3	Fiddly controls and realistic obstacles make conquering the wilderness a healthy challenge. \n
20608	2975	1	1	Players hunt small animals with slingshots, but cartoon depiction keeps it from being disturbing.\n
20609	2975	2	1	Unlucky trail walkers can end up traveling in their underwear, but there's nothing suggestive, and animation style is blocky, not realistic. \n

20611	2975	4	4	Players are often prompted to watch commercials to get free gifts, and users can make purchases with real money.\n

20627	2977	6	4	Kids can learn about scientific concepts like reflection and simple machines as well as develop problem-solving and strategic-thinking skills. Since there's no easy way out of any challenge -- no hints or skips -- kids can develop resilience and grit, too, persevering through each level until they solve it.\n

20641	2979	6	4	Kids can get inspired to move their bodies in fun, new ways. They can learn dance routines, yoga poses, breathing techniques, aerobic exercises, and more. With the upbeat, positive approach, kids can also learn that moving and exercising can be fun and can make them feel good. They may also learn a few "academic" things with some songs that focus on learning content such as counting syllables, traveling across the 50 states, and the importance of voting.\n
20642	2980	0	4	Much of the navigation is easy, and tapping through the story is straightforward. Getting the levers to stop where you want them in the "roll" game may be a bit of a challenge.\n
20643	2980	1	1	The wild animals threaten to eat Grandma, but there's no actual violence shown.\n

20648	2980	6	3	Kids can cultivate a love of reading and practice their reading skills as they follow along with the narration or read on their own. By immersing themselves in fiction and enjoying the feeling of being taken away into someone else's world, kids can learn to appreciate the power of storytelling. Kids can also express their own creativity in the record section. The gourd game is designed to get kids thinking about physics and trajectory, but the concepts will probably be lost on most kids without adult guidance. Kids can also explore elements of Grandma's culture.\n
20649	2981	0	3	On the first levels, a hand graphic clearly demonstrates how to play the game. Sometimes it's difficult to move the blocks to exactly where they need to be, which may be especially challenging for young kids with less fine motor control.\n

20656	2982	0	4	Simple touchscreen controls, though buttons are quite small and it's easy to tap the wrong one.\n
20657	2982	1	1	Players hurl insults at each other to cause them physical pain, but the comments are silly.\n
20658	2982	2	1	One insult involves a "steamy romp."\n
20659	2982	3	2	The game has you insulting other people, both real and virtual. While there are no obscenities, you do use such ribald words as "fart."\n

20669	2983	6	3	Kids can learn about challenging math topics that may be tricky for them on Yup. Topics include pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and basic calculus. There isn't any content built into the app; everything that the tutors teach is based on the questions kids ask. Efforts to make the app more user-friendly by adding more math symbols and more accessible by adding audio output features would boost its learning value, as would written extension materials.\n
20670	2984	0	3	Simple point and swipe, if players can navigate around intrusive ads (or if parents pay to remove the ads).\n

There's a "More Apps" icon on the main screen, banner ads for companies such as Exxon Mobil and Plenti, and a shopping cart icon that leads kids to in-app purchases. A full-screen pop-up ad for another app appears after you press Play for the game. Full-screen ads continue to appear intermittently throughout gameplay. Banner ads remain on the screen throughout play, and ads can only be removed via a $0.99 in-app purchase. Access to all rooms in the house is only available via a $4.99 in-app purchase. No in-app gate on purchases or downloads.\n

20683	2985	6	3	Kids can learn about a handful of types of content that can be inappropriate or dangerous to post on social media. The discussion and critical-thinking prompts encourage kids to delve deep into understanding why they should avoid posting certain content. Step-by-step instructions also guide kids in editing posts or adjusting privacy settings. Though parents can get reports on what their kids are doing, Oyoty empowers kids to fix problem posts on their own. And if kids want to discuss further, they can flag an issue for discussion with their parents, which can help open lines of communication.\n
20684	2986	0	4	Navigation is smooth as kids explore different areas on the farm. Sometimes it can be awkward to place objects where you want them or difficult to pick up small objects.\n

20690	2986	6	4	Though there are no clear learning objectives, kids will feel empowered to be in control and in charge of everything that happens on their farm. They'll practice storytelling and try on different personas as they set scenes, create characters, and craft stories. Kids can also experience a bit of what goes into producing the food they find on their supermarket shelves. With parent involvement, the learning potential is higher.\n
20691	2987	0	3	Very easy to play, practically speaking, but very little context to provide meaning to use.\n
20692	2987	1	0	
20693	2987	2	2	Suggestive usernames, suggestive clothing (including shirtless male characters), essentially open chat for sexual content, as users can work around the filter.\n

20695	2987	4	5	All things consumerism, glitz, and celebrity lifestyle, all the time. Coins appear and rain down for numerous reasons, with multiple options throughout the app to spend those coins. Some sections are restricted until users purchase a VIP pass via in-app purchases, which range from only a couple of dollars to $69.99.\n

20837	3007	6	3	Kids can learn how to say common words in English. They'll see a picture of the word and hear its English name and then practice matching the pictures to names from memory. Kids may end up remembering the new words, but the app's dry approach may cause some kids to quit.\n
20838	3008	0	4	Navigation tricky at first, but PewDiePie himself walks you through how to use the app on first launch, and it's easy to replay the instructions.\n
20839	3008	1	1	Some of the randomly generated video titles might a bit violent or scary, but there's no real violence here.\n
20840	3008	2	1	Some provocative language can appear in the randomly generated video titles, but there's nothing explicitly sexual within the app.\n

20842	3008	4	4	Though you can play the game for free, it's enormously appealing to spend a dollar -- or more -- throughout to speed up gameplay and access more in-game accessories. There are links to buy other PewDiePie apps from the same developer, and some video pop-up ads appear periodically. \n

20907	3017	6	3	Kids can learn how to develop novel solutions to problems as they read (or listen to) this real-life story of kids helping their grandma overcome her fear of flying. This story also touches on lessons in empathy and kindness. Seven tasks and four games touch on basic preschool skills such as sequencing, color recognition, numbers, visual discrimination, and spatial organization. Note: Measurements mentioned on this app use the metric system.\n
20908	3018	0	4	Controls are intuitive, requiring kids to tap and drag and drop over small distances, and there are some prompts but no actual instructions. Kids may not know they need to take a dirty outfit from the laundry basket and the outfit on the character and place them both in the washing machine. Younger kids may not know the wash needs detergent or where to put it. \n

20933	3021	4	4	Though it's a free game with no overt ads, it's designed to teach capitalism. The core mechanic of the game is completing "jobs" to earn coins, then using those coins to purchase bigger, better rewards or entertainment and dining, which earns energy for power-ups. While the vocabulary in quizzes promotes responsible money management, the overall message is that to win, you have to make money, spend money to get energy, buy things.\n
20934	3021	5	0	
20935	3021	6	2	Kids will get at the very least some meaningful exposure to financial-management terms and processes, but the game is quite playable and pretty fun without you ever needing to master their real-world meaning. Very basic, early introduction to concepts like interest, budgeting, and investment, but will need adult support for any learning to stick. \n
20936	3022	0	3	Controls require a "tap and drag," which should be comfortable for most kids in the target age. There are no directions for kids and no verbal prompts unless kids try to use the wrong truck for the job. Kids should eventually realize that the construction jobs are color-coded for the appropriate truck, but this is never explicitly stated. A special icon appears when a truck is dirty that corresponds to a small icon on the car wash. \n

20942	3022	6	1	Created with educational intent, but we don't recommend it for learning. Link between truck and the task at hand is reduced to some very simple color matching (kids figure this out themselves). Kids don't actually see the truck in action or learn more about it, they aren't told that a truck might need a wash because it's dirty, and they don't actually have to make any real decisions about anything in the experience, so no creative options.\n

20950	3024	0	3	There are no audio instructions, so reading fluency (or having an adult read the on-screen instructions) is necessary for kids to really understand what's happening on this app; otherwise, kids will simply be tapping where the hand icon points next, things will happen, and it all likely will seem pretty random.\n

20986	3029	1	1	Some videos contain friendly monsters such as Moshi Monsters and Monster Math Squad, which most kids will find cute and silly. Others, like the Reading Rainbow series, are age-appropriate, but may have trigger content for some young kids, such as a story of a child with a parent in the military and some bossy siblings and kids who won't share.\n

21012	3032	6	3	Kids can learn the basics of how triangles, rectangles, and circles combine to make 15 objects, such as trees, dogs, and umbrellas. This app requires kids to trace on or near each line to form shapes. As a result, kids practice fine motor and precise on-screen finger movements.\n
21013	3033	0	3	Simple interface and easy-to-understand icons show kids what to do. Art tool isn't as easy to create with as some of the drawings displayed may lead kids to believe, which may cause some artistic frustration in some kids.\n

21084	3043	1	0	No violence generated by the app, but user-created content -- such as the communities for horror and TV shows such as Game of Thrones --  definitely touch on violent themes.\n
21085	3043	2	0	No sexual content generated by app, but definitely sexual content in some communities, including those for anime and some musicians.\n
21086	3043	3	0	No profanity generated by app, but there's limited content moderation, so kids could definitely encounter some strong language.\n
21087	3043	4	1	There's nothing explicitly for sale within the app, though some users might feel prompted to buy songs or download media that other community members discuss.\n
21088	3043	5	0	No drug references generated by app, but there are no limits on posts about drinking, drugs, or smoking.\n

21098	3045	1	1	Talking Tom is chasing a robber and will inevitably run into all sorts of obstacles, including moving cars, which renders him either confused or unconscious, rather like watching a piano fall on an old-school cartoon character.\n

21101	3045	4	4	Between on-going advertising, a link to a YouTube channel for the franchise's characters, and the fact that this is all about gold, consumerism is quite high. Kids are exposed to some full-screen advertising, as well as the chance to watch advertising videos to earn in-game cash. In-app purchases aid progress and don't have a parent gate.\n

21112	3047	1	1	Content is curated by Narvii administrators and is designated with a PG rating. But the sheer volume of content within the app probably makes oversight difficult. \n
21113	3047	2	0	Narvii's guidelines feature strict prohibitions against nudity and sexual content as well as sexual subject matter in chat. Users who engage in such things can be banned from the app. \n
21114	3047	3	2	Guidelines prohibit "excessive swearing," but chat and posts can contain cursing. \n
21115	3047	4	1	Guidelines do not permit users to promote themselves or commercial products. Some of this is likely to slip through, however, due to the sheer amount of user-created content. App content based on popular franchise.\n

21126	3049	1	3	Kids can learn about the steps involved in cooking a dish from scratch, from chopping and grating ingredients to mixing, cooking, and finally garnishing their creations. It's a purely creative free-play sandbox game, and kids can get some lightly expressive creative learning out of it, but without some kind of gallery, recipe creator, or record of dishes created, or more guidance or suggestions for making Boffo happy, it's not really poised for deep learning. \n

21210	3061	1	0	
21146	3052	0	3	On-screen instructions guide kids into play. So long as kids understand the three basic parts of the game -- city building, shooting, and collecting cards to build weapons -- it's pretty straightforward. One play frustration: Players get locked out of the game when they need time to "heal," and it's a long time (about 24 hours). Online "cheats" are readily available.\n
21147	3052	1	3	Frequent cartoon violence can be pretty intense, especially when combined with the spooky ghost creatures players are shooting. The weapons and sound effects may be too intense and scary for many kids.\n

There's a strong emphasis on earning "gold" and collecting money in the game to be able to buy new cards, buy buildings and upgrades to buildings and proton packs.

21169	3055	2	4	With no parental controls available, kids can browse to movies with full-frontal nudity, R-rated sex scenes, and so on. As of publication, the more mature sexual content (rated MA) is only available on the website, not via the app.\n
21170	3055	3	5	As there are no parental controls available, kids can access movies with all manner of language from curse words to derogatory language.\n
21171	3055	4	4	Commercials often appear before movies with no option to skip them.\n
21172	3055	5	5	As there are no parental controls available, kids have access to R-rated movies with significant drug, tobacco, and alcohol use, including the glorification of these as lifestyle choices.\n

21182	3057	1	2	Mild cartoon-style violence during the battles, but some of it can be rather aggressive as the losing "fig" is thrown back violently or hit repeatedly. \n
21183	3057	2	0	
21184	3057	3	1	No profanity; however, this app has a lot of snarky and mean talk such as "twerp," "annoying kid," and "stupid."\n
21185	3057	4	3	Logos for Cartoon Network, DC Comics, Warner Bros., and the app's developer (Grumpyface) all appear whenever kids open the app. No actual in-app purchases, but part of the gameplay is based on kids collecting up to 70 Teen Titans action figures, a few of which can be purchased in real stores.\n

21191	3058	3	3	Some games contain profanity, and user comments can get salty.\n
21192	3058	4	3	Though you don't have to pay to use Mobcrush, a lot of the streams are for paid games, and gameplay can feel a lot like watching product endorsements.\n

21224	3063	1	4	Police brutality, interrogation, beating, torture, death, blood, and weapons, though all is related to historical circumstances and isn't gratutitous.\n

If they post their story to the community, they'll get feedback by tracking how many reads their story gets and can engage with other readers and creators through forums and comments sections. \n
21259	3068	1	0	User-submitted stories must adhere to Episode's rules but are not as thoroughly screened. It is possible that violent content could show up in user-submitted stories. There are also some references to threatened violence ("I'm going to beat you up!"), some mild scenes of punching or hitting, and a good amount of relational aggression.\n
21260	3068	2	3	Nothing gets more visually explicit than some kissing scenes, but there's lots and lots of language about attraction, sex, "hooking up," dating, and more. At least one story with choice of gender for romantic partner. Many plots focus almost exclusively on mature themes, such as looking for a sex partner, or feature characters who seem to think of nothing else. Frequent sexual innuendo in the characters' language, such as, "Didn't he sleep with half the school?" Outfits are often tight and revealing and accentuate the sexual nature of both the female and male body.\n
21261	3068	3	2	Mild swearing such as "hell," "bitch," "d--k," "asshole," "damn," "c--k block," and "s--t."\n
21262	3068	4	5	Characters glorify shopping and refer to brands by name, such as Mercedes. Stories are often interrupted by short app commercials that cannot be skipped. Though kids can advance through the stories without making any purchases, there are aggressive pushes to get users to buy gems and passes, and it feels like you can't make the choices you want to without enough gems, which cost real money. In one story, users are rewarded for leading the main character to promote a fictional brand.\n

Kids will practice matching quantity to number as they construct packages with the right quantity of blocks to match the target number on each level. They'll practice recognizing amounts without counting, combining small numbers to create larger ones (2 and 3 make 5, as do 1 and 4), and dividing numbers into smaller parts (3 can be 1, 1, and 1). This basic number construction naturally evolves into adding and subtracting, which kids practice on higher levels. Through an emphasis on creating groups of five and 10 blocks, kids will also get a basic understanding of the decimal system. Fiete Math gives kids lots of practice manipulating numbers through appealing artwork and charm.\n

By accumulating larger forests, kids can easily see their increased time spent engaging in various activities, and they can practice working without distractions. Once users accumulate 2,500 coins, the developer will make a donation of a live tree to Trees for the Future, which roots the app even more deeply in the real world. For kids, teens, and grown-ups who are ready to fight phone distraction, Forest: Stay focused, be present is a helpful tool with appealing incentives.\n

Get a sense of size, distance, and scale in outer space and learn about what the planets are made of and how humans landed on the moon. For all the facts, graphics, and explanations, there's also plenty of room for kids to gain a general sense of wonder and excitement about outer space. Some kids may not love the format of the true/false quizzes and may have trouble answering the questions if they're just clicking around and exploring; a more informal assessment tool would be more fun for kids. However, especially for kids who can't get enough of astronomy, Professor Astro Cat's Solar System may inspire curiosity as it answers questions.\n

21608	3118	0	3	Kids can learn about the kinds of resources required for undeveloped regions of the world to become sustainable communities. Working with water sources, housing, crops, health, education, and disaster preparedness, kids will realize just how much work goes into a sustainable community and are likely to begin seeing those same kinds of resources in their day-to-day lives. Kids will also learn how these resources are often interdependent: Crops require water, the people who work the crops require housing, and so on. Also, the in-game money is a limited resource, and kids will learn to conserve it by configuring efficient solutions to each sustainability puzzle. Sustainaville - An Ethical Game takes the real work of building communities and transforms it into a fun, challenging, and thoughtful simulation for kids that lets them give back in the real world.\n

If players click the Save the Children button within the game, they are given a parental check meant to prevent young kids from accessing this part of the site.

Experiment with how the sun and air temperatures affect land, water, and our behavior and comfort level. Learn about wind and air currents and their role in creating weather. Look at the water cycle and clouds and learn terms such as "precipitation," "evaporation," and "condensation." See how all these things come together to create storms, snow, rain, and more. Explore freely, but use the guide and labels to get the most out of Weather by Tinybop.\n

21650	3124	0	4	Kids can learn about reading and understanding sight words, spelling patterns, and storytelling. They'll use logic and reasoning -- and luck -- to guess words, letter by letter. Once they've guessed a word, they'll get some motor practice as they trace its letters, though the tracing instruction and mechanics aren't great. Culturally diverse drawings that accompany words help kids learn what the words mean and expose them to people, history, and objects from around the world. By making their own drawings, kids express their own interpretations of the words. The storytelling section encourages kids to get even more creative. They'll also practice forming sentences, using words in context, and constructing a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Kids get multifaceted practice with sight words in HangArt: Play Hangman, Draw Pictures, Tell Stories.\n

21665	3126	1	1	Some oblique references to wanting to hurt someone because of a disagreement; nothing on-screen.\n
21666	3126	2	3	From silhouettes of scantily clad women on the beach at Santa Monica to some very revealing clothing choices for female avatars, there's some seriously risqué illustration going on here. Also, going on dates and flirting with people is a major component of playing the game.\n
21667	3126	3	2	Some mild swearing, including "damn," "ass," and "badass."\n
21668	3126	4	4	Everything's for sale in this app, from access to parties and places to increasingly expensive clothing and accessories, and there's a distinct focus on having the right clothes and lots of money.\n
21669	3126	5	4	Casual references to drinking and several images of smoking appear throughout the app, and going to get a drink is something that's mentioned often, with no safeguard in place to determine users' ages or a way to bypass such activities. \n
21670	3126	6	-1	
21671	3127	0	3	Basic movement and controls are extremely simple, but interface is complicated. There are lots of menus and submenus and icons that look like buttons but aren't buttons. Once you put in a few hours, these all become more intuitive, but for beginning players it's all a bit overwhelming. \n
21672	3127	1	3	Plenty of cartoon violence against monster aliens; cartoonish death animations when the main character dies, but the bulk of the violence involves flailing fantasy weapons about and dodging stomps and lasers. \n
21673	3127	2	1	Very occasional bawdy references in the dialogue, but they're extremely mild.\n
21674	3127	3	1	The game's dialogue features a healthy dose of goofy crude humor and some bathroom talk and name-calling ("dang," "poop," "heck," "jerk," "idiot," "weirdo"), but it's always playful and never mean-spirited.\n
21675	3127	4	1	Lots of links to the developer's site, including the option to create an account specifically for use with Butterscotch Shenanigans games, but not mandatory to enjoy the game.\n

21699	3131	0	3	Controls take a little while to figure out (there's no tutorial or guide), though once you get them down, they're very simple; however, sometimes swipes don't register correctly. On smaller screens especially (such as the iPhone 5s) this causes problems, but the issue still persists on larger devices (such as the iPad). \n
21700	3131	1	2	Kids can learn logical sequencing, spatial reasoning, problem solving, and perseverance. Because the game requires a fairly strong ability to succeed but also features a gradual learning curve, it's essentially scaffolded practice, and kids can try out their strategies with no devastating consequences: If Lara Croft dies, the level just starts over. Also, kids probably won't ever realize they're learning these things, which means they'll likely put in a good amount of productive playtime. While Lara Croft GO was made to entertain, and its skills don't easily transfer to the real world, it does require a lot of problem solving and persistence.\n
21701	3131	2	1	Lara Croft's signature skimpy outfit with a low-cut tank top showing minor cleavage and very short shorts showing lots of leg. Unlockable outfits vary in modesty.\n

21706	3132	0	5	Everything from the sign-up process to "calibration" to modifying settings is extremely easy and intuitive, and gameplay couldn't be smoother.\n
21707	3132	1	3	Kids can learn how to do the exercises more quickly and precisely and might pick up a word or two in a foreign language. They also might be able to translate some of their experience working under pressure to other timed activities. The developers make some pretty big claims, and though it's surely true that persistence through the app's many games will result in improvement within those exercises, contemporary research shows no real evidence that those improvements translate to real life. If used with low expectations and an eye on working under pressure, Fit Brains Trainer is an entertaining distraction that may not live up to its claims but may be a way for kids to practice working under time restraints.\n

21710	3132	4	3	Doing more than a small amount of daily training requires a subscription, which can get pretty pricey. While there aren't a lot of pop-up reminders or other obtrusive ads, there are plenty of "locked" icons, which bring up an in-app-purchase screen without a parent gate.\n

21713	3133	0	3	A lot of features and interactions and not all are intuitive. Only basic tutorial. On slightly older hardware, some buttons require a few taps before they respond.\n
21714	3133	1	2	Kids can learn a very limited amount of animal trivia and may pick up some lessons about interacting with others online. There are small pieces of animal trivia scattered throughout the playground-like world, which kids can tap to get a quick animal fact, very brief facts on each loading screen, and a location in the game with a small library of animal videos (all of which are available elsewhere on the Internet for free), but none of it promotes learning in a meaningful way. Also, kids sometimes scam each other through the trading mechanic, so while most of their interactions will be benign and fun, kids might learn that online interactions aren't always nice. This may be a reasonably fun game with opportunities for kids to be social, but the overwhelming message of Animal Jam - Play Wild! is one of consumerism, not animal awareness and conservation. \n

21720	3134	0	4	Kids can practice reading skills, learn more about their reading habits and skills, and learn about a multitude of topics. As they browse books by genre, choose books to read, and then rate each book, kids are making decisions and thinking critically about what they read. When reviewing their own reading stats (time read, number of pages flipped, number of books read), kids are learning to self-assess effort, progress, and goals. Using a safe search tool, young kids can learn how to find books by keyword within the app. Kids will find lots of books to learn from and enjoy on Epic! - Unlimited Books for Kids.\n
21721	3134	1	1	Some of the adventure, fantasy, historical, or graphic novels at the older end of the age range (11–12) contain moderately violent themes.\n

21728	3135	1	3	Point of the game is to build up a base and then wage war on other players, but combat is completely abstract and is represented simply by icons moving across a map.\n

21734	3136	0	3	It takes some experimenting to figure out all the features of this game. An initial walk-through offers a good introduction, but it's not clear what you should focus on with your dragon from day to day.\n
21735	3136	1	1	Some very mild cartoon violence takes place in the dragon battles: Fire and beams of light shoot from one dragon to another, but there's nothing gory or gross.\n
21736	3136	2	0	You can breed your dragons, but they mostly just look excited and then a new dragon appears.\n
21737	3136	3	0	
21738	3136	4	5	In-app purchases abound: Though you can get daily in-app currency rewards by completing tasks or claiming them each day, there are tons of opportunities to pay money to level up your dragons and their accessories. Also, users are invited to get free gems by signing up for surveys and services and downloading apps; there's no parent gate on these areas.\n
21745	3137	4	3	To collect in-game powers, players need QR codes that come from purchasing real-world Lego toys. Without this, play is possible but basic.\n

21754	3138	6	-1	
21755	3139	0	3	Kids can learn how to spell verbs and expand their vocabulary: The spelling isn't that challenging, but the vocabulary is more advanced. Play starts with basic words such as "pull," advances to words with blends such as "grab," and then moves into more sophisticated vocabulary with words such as "sever." Hints come very quickly, with only the correct letter choice shown after a few seconds. Though this is billed as a spelling game, kids will probably find vocabulary building to be the biggest learning benefit of playing Tiggly Doctor: Spell Verbs and Perform Actions Like a Real Doctor.\n

21771	3141	2	3	Some sexy stuff, including "musers" in revealing clothing, dancing suggestively, or singing provocative lyrics. Experience will vary widely depending on how you browse and what you choose to watch. \n
21772	3141	3	4	Between lip-synched popular songs and original compositions, there's a lot of variety here. Some songs are G-rated, but there's also music featured with mature themes and strong language such as "bitch," "p---y," and "motherf----r."\n
21773	3141	4	3	Lots of the content is user-generated, but some comes directly from professional artists and performers. Listening to songs on this platform might make kids want to buy those songs elsewhere. As of 2017, brands are also advertising in videos on the platform, and there's a virtual marketplace where users can sell and exchange songs and AR objects.\n

The mildest content currently available contains light swear words such as "ass" and "dick," while the more R-rated titles have very frequent strong language, such as "f--k."

Though the experience is mostly passive, kids can create narratives around Jack's adventures, and parents can help them apply what they observe in the app to real life.

22077	3185	0	3	Choose joystick or traditional arrow controls. Maneuvering characters can be very tricky.\n
21798	3145	1	2	Kids can learn how to quickly recognize very simple true/false equations involving single digits and the four arithmetic operations, but though it's certainly useful to verify these on sight, there are much better ways to teach kids a meaningful intuition for basic calculations. Here, they're presented basically as flash cards with a snowball-throwing mechanic and popular movie characters, which may increase the excitement of playing the game but won't do anything for the quality of learning. Though kids can review what they got right and wrong after each round, the correct answers aren't available. All in all, Norm of the North's Digit Dodge is a math game designed to get kids excited about a film franchise, not a game with movie characters designed to get kids excited about math.\n

They can also get silly as they use blocks to build worlds that stretch their imaginations and add infinite personal touches that express their unique sense of creativity. Any stories kids tell about the world they create or the characters who explore that world takes learning even further.

Learning areas include arts, emotional development, health, literacy, logic and reasoning, math, science, and social development, with dozens of featured videos and interactive games for each area. The clips are part of the televised program but give parents and kids a way to get the specific content they want to see. If kids are learning the number 4, for example, parents can easily find a video for that number. Kids will learn and be entertained with Sesame Street Go, and parents can feel good about the content -- and may enjoy it themselves.\n

Overall, however, TMNT Battle Match - Ninja Turtles Matching Game wasn't created with learning intent and contains very limited educational value.  \n

Parents can help the educational experience by engaging kids in conversation and real-world experiences to support what kids are watching.

They'll work with motion blocks and triggering blocks as well as control blocks, such as repeat for looping, to control the characters in their story. They'll develop creatively as they create their own narratives by directing the characters and create original drawings to incorporate into their programs. There's no step-by-step instruction, however, and no training modules, so it's more about the creative process.

21867	3155	0	3	Kids can learn a lot from spending some time in another's shoes, immersed in someone else's world. There's great learning potential in exploring these spaces and looking into faces of people who surround you in the virtual experience. As more stories become available, kids will be able to encounter all sorts of different locations and people and feel as though they have a first-person perspective of contexts they might not experience otherwise. Though NYT VR - Virtual Reality Stories the NYTimes isn't offering instructional content, it is connecting kids virtually to events and people all around the world.\n

21874	3156	0	3	Kids can learn all about the Nutcracker and about ballet, dance history, San Francisco history, music, and more. The storybook faithfully retells the classic story. Video interviews with the conductor of the San Francisco Ballet orchestra helps kids appreciate how the music works in tandem with the set and dancers to tell the story and convey emotion. Interviews with the dancers, including kids, can demonstrate what it's like to dance in a professional production, and dance-along videos may inspire kids to get moving themselves. Archival photos show what San Francisco was like at the turn of the century and explore the city's unique architecture. Though some technical glitches put a damper on its overall success, San Francisco Nutcracker Interactive Storybook is a great extension of the ballet for kid fans and peeks into the history and production details.\n
21875	3156	1	1	Light theatrical coverage of the nutcracker and his toy soldiers battling with the mice and their mouse king using swords and toy cannons. A large mousetrap brings down the mouse king.\n

21888	3158	0	3	Kids can learn the stories behind a variety of important historical people, events, or world phenomena. Read about Marie Curie, Simon Bolivar, the pyramids, the animals in the African savannah, and discovering fire. Since each topic is presented as an adventure, kids can get a sense of the excitement and importance of the contributions by the people or events described. Kids also get some practice with a common testing format that they'll likely come across in school: multiple-choice questions that test reading comprehension. And, if kids read on their own, they can practice their reading skills. Though BPT - Educational Storybooks for Children (Preschool & Primary) doesn't have the production value some parents may expect, it does provide solid reading opportunities about important topics.\n

As most kids'-movie stories are, this one is all about facing your fears, personal growth through perseverance, and valuing, appreciating, and protecting those who are close to you. Some kids will get it, but it's possible the positive messages of The Good Dinosaur: Storybook Deluxe will take a backseat to the games and adventure.\n

This means ustyme may bring kids the world of benefits associated with reading in general, including but not limited to a love of reading, an emotional connection with a loved one, critical and flexible thinking, room for imagination and creativity, vocabulary development, and a basis for learning how to read.\n

Comparing whole Nooms and stacked Nooms lets kids explore size and concepts of bigger, smaller, and equal. The number line helps kids get a sense of how numbers relate to each other, and handing in coins to buy new levels lets kids count backward and see subtraction in action. Completing the puzzles and challenges in DragonBox Numbers requires some creativity, flexible thinking, and problem-solving skills, but kids will likely just enjoy playing with the Nooms.\n

21944	3166	0	3	Kids can learn about flexibility in creating simple consonant-vowel-consonant words such as "cab," "cub," and "cob." With the consonants remaining constant, kids can see how changing the middle vowel changes how the word is pronounced and its meaning. This is part of understanding how letters form words, which represent things (or concepts, places, and so on). Some of the word combinations are probably new to kids (and parents, too -- "fen," anyone?), so they'll also learn vocabulary. Putting kids in charge to create words -- and their resulting animations -- empowers them to feel in control. And the story-telling option provides a platform for them to be creative. Despite some minor glitches and limited combination possibilities, Tiggly Story Maker: Build Words and Record Your Own Tales is a fun way for kids to take charge of some word building and storytelling.\n

Beyond simple counting, addition, and the like, most actual mathematical learning will happen outside the app. Yet by doing simple math problems every day, kids may form a familiarity with math that can allow them to feel comfortable in their mathematical abilities as they progress through more challenging math problems in school and in life. Though the Bedtime Math app is a more mobile way to access this daily math routine, the website is probably a better choice in terms of features.\n

21965	3169	0	4	Kids can learn about artistic and design techniques through the video lessons. They'll then apply what they've learned and see the results as they color and place their designs into the app. Lessons cover concepts such as primary colors and mixing colors, the effect of pressure when coloring, and more, each getting more in depth. The characters are somewhat diverse in terms of skin color and gender, showing that fashion design is for everyone. Creativas Fashion Design Studio empowers kids to get creative and have fashionable fun while teaching relevant art skills and concepts.\n

There's no direct instruction about music or notes, but kids can easily pick up on the tunes. The programming involved is more limited than some of the other Wonder Workshop apps. Curious kids who have both robots may enjoy experimenting to see how Dot responds to Xylo's music. Though not perfect, Xylo for Dash Robot is a fun way to combine music and robotics for young kids.\n

Sample literary analysis paragraphs are available for most devices, too, demonstrating how students would compose their own for other works. The examples included are from classic literature and, though they lack diversity, are great preparation for AP literature exams. Though Literary Analysis Guide might have limited appeal, it provides an interactive resource for kids to reference from a mobile device rather than a reference book.\n

21986	3172	0	3	Kids can learn about electrical circuits and energy flow by playing with components to generate electrical signals. Puzzles become increasingly difficult as kids progress, which may keep kids engaged longer if they don't get frustrated. Kids get instant visual feedback as they work with the circuits, but some hints could help guide kids who struggle to solve the puzzles. The sandbox mode is a great opportunity for kids to replicate and test their own circuit problems or freely experiment with circuit building. Though a little more instructional guidance and help would be great, Circuit Jam is a fun and challenging way for budding engineers to explore electricity, circuits, and problem solving.\n

21993	3173	0	3	Kids can learn to make reading a part of their daily routine. They'll practice the mechanics of reading as they follow along in the text while listening to the narrator read aloud or try reading themselves. One book a day may encourage kids to come back day after day to find what's waiting for them, which may help make reading a habit. Some story lines are more successful than others in tapping into what makes kids love reading. Because the reading support options are strong, Read Me Stories - Children's books does have some learning value, but the quality of the content could be better.\n

22000	3174	0	4	Kids can learn the logic and processes involved with robotics programming using this visual language. They'll choose the commands they want to use and drag them into place, connecting them in the order they'd like. They can incorporate conditional clauses (if I do this, then do this) and looping (which truly is visually a loop on the screen) to their programs and customize sounds and movements. Through other Wonder Workshop apps or in Wonder's Scroll Quests, kids get to practice the commands they've learned to create their own programs and watch them run on the robots. With Wonder for Dash & Dot Robots kids are empowered to create and control the digital elements they love to use.\n

22007	3175	0	4	Kids can learn programming logic and basic robotics. Drawing the path with their fingers gives them a visual representation of the order in which the events occur. The biggest challenge for kids is predicting how the robot will move in the actual room as they complete the path on a screen, but even that is forgiving. If the robot encounters an obstacle, kids can move it and continue the program or start over. After they follow the prescribed paths, kids can create their own, igniting creativity and problem solving. Path for Dash Robot makes an excellent introduction to programming and robotics for kids.\n

As they tinker, kids can set values on some blocks to increase or decrease effects, and they can be creative in designing their characters. Though the tools are somewhat limited, Codeable Crafts is a combination of storytelling and elementary coding, which will help empower kids to see themselves as creators.\n

22014	3176	0	3	Kids can learn about processes that shape Earth's surface, including weathering, erosion, and deposition. They learn how these processes change Earth and contribute to the formation of landforms such as mountains and sand dunes. Kids also can explore fascinating features such as hot spots, stalactites, and stalagmites. They swipe and tap to learn about Earth's layers, and they can create volcanic eruptions and mild earthquakes. Kids who are comfortable with a free-play environment will benefit most from this learning tool. However, for more structure, a teaching handbook is available to download from the developer's website. Either way, it's important to reinforce the idea that most of the processes that change Earth's surface occur over millions of years, which might be difficult for some younger kids to grasp. Though the concepts might be lost on some, The Earth by Tinybop is a beautiful and fun way to explore the changing planet.\n

22021	3177	0	3	Kids can learn about what it's like to care for a baby. When baby gets bored, dirty, hungry, or simply unhappy, it cries for attention, which can convey a sense of the acute level of attention babies need. Baby makes happy, sad, or scared faces in response to different toys or dress-up items, giving kids a chance to practice responding to someone else's feelings, which is the basis for empathy. Consider playing and discussing with your kids to enrich the experience and deepen the learning potential. Pretend play in general helps kids try out different roles and stretches their imaginations, and Sago Mini Babies gives kids opportunities to practice compassion and perspective-taking. \n

Meant to be more of an introduction to the robots and a way to demonstrate what they can do, the app doesn't include any actual programming. Rather, kids are pressing icons and learning what the robots can do; they can learn through the other apps how to make them do those things in a sequence. Go for Dash & Dot Robots ranks higher on the fun scale than it does on learning, but it's a great starting point to get kids excited about the Dash and Dot system.\n

They'll work with programming concepts such as sequencing, events, loops, algorithms, conditionals, and variables as they drag and drop the code into place to control the robots. The larger robot, Dash, moves on wheels and can light up and make sounds. Dot, the smaller, is designed to be touched -- shaken, tilted, dropped -- and respond, also with lights and sounds. There are lots of programming apps that teach kids how to use blocks of code, but with Blockly for Dash & Dot Robots, kids see their code come to life.\n

They can also learn how one kind of creature can be scared of the dark while another, with a different set of physical traits, might not. Through experimentation, kids will figure out which pieces of the puzzle change the creatures in particular ways, and they'll have a lot of fun manipulating their creations. Though the actual concepts of DNA aren't taught, DNA Play is a fantastic launching point for broader and deeper discussions on genetics and what makes up people and animals.\n

An initial assessment places kids according to their personal literacy level, and material adapts as they progress. Kids can practice skills they already know or are in the process of learning, but with the multiple-choice, trial-and-error format, they won't learn much new material. Though the overall coverage of concepts is broad and adaptive, Kid Awesome Kindergarten English Premium – Master the First Year of Language Learning! is relatively disjointed, and the most exciting parts of the game are separate from the parts that involve learning.  \n

For kids who don't intend to hurt anyone, the stop-and-think nature of the app might ensure that they truly say what they mean. If kids are writing something iffy in the heat of the moment, the pop-up message may help them calm down. Especially when used within a community, ReThink - Stop Cyberbullying can be one important element of several prevention strategies to stop hurt feelings before they start.\n

There's no direct instruction about habitats, or even the vocabulary, but kids are still thinking through the process while they're immersed in play -- just the way young kids learn best. They'll be creative and take silly risks as well as get outside and look at the world around them with the eyes of a scientist thinking about the animal they're studying. Plum's Creaturizer is a silly, creative game that packs quite a bit of educational value for kids.\n

The meat of the classic preschool activities may not have an impact, though, as the drawing, completing dot-to-dots, and building with blocks won't really develop fine motor control as well as those activities do offscreen. Pacca Alpaca Travel includes enough variety that kids will come away having some fun and maybe learning something, but it's not a standout among preschool learning games.\n

Facts are mostly delivered by a narrator, but kids also discover hands-on as they play in the arctic sandbox, moving the animals around and feeding them. MarcoPolo Arctic introduces kids to sophisticated vocabulary related to animals and the arctic and lets them learn hands-on through the virtual world.\n

With a subscription, kids also can see step-by-step instructions on how to solve complex problems in most types of math they'll encounter. Getting one step at a time, just to get through the sticky parts, would be a great addition, as would instructional walkthroughs with hints. As it stands, Mathway certainly works as a shortcut to the answer for some kids, but it's also a great tool for helping kids work through complex problems.\n

They can create paintings and play with their caterpillar, so they aren't necessarily getting an accurate scientific view, but the activities are age-appropriate. For really little kids, My Very Hungry Caterpillar offers a chance to learn how to navigate in an app, the nature of cause and effect, and what it takes to care for living things.\n

The constellation game lets kids rotate shapes to match a picture, and the knitting game asks kids to find colored yarn. Though it's meant for entertainment for kids who love the show, Clangers - Playtime Planet does offer some shallow learning opportunities.\n

22224	3206	0	4	Kids can learn to sort and order objects by like features, test their own theories, narrow down choices using logic, use observational skills, and build on what they've discovered. One of the puzzles mimics the logic found in simple computer programs, helping kids understand the process behind if/then conditional statements. Because the game is adaptive and gets trickier as kids succeed, it can grow as kids figure it out. Also, since kids can lose one part of the game and still bounce back by retrieving lost Zoombinis, kids practice perseverance. The app's only shortcoming is its lack of a tutorial and ongoing help or hints; a deeper introduction or parent guide would help remedy the lack of guidance. Wrapped up in a clever adventure-style game, Zoombinis still sets high learning standards and will continue to captivate kids.\n
22225	3206	1	1	Zoombinis are bounced off bridges, rolled down stone paths, dropped off hotel window ledges, and otherwise bumped around. However, they just shake it off and continue.\n

As they watch animations and listen to definitions of words they may never have heard before, kids can learn new words.

Using Scholly: Scholarship Search to start their scholarship search can help them get oriented to the components of a college application and introduce them to types of scholarships they may not have known about. Though having a focused, contained scholarship search is really helpful, there are some limitations: Common majors aren't represented, the sample essays aren't very helpful, and exporting all search results (including deadlines) would make it even more useful. However, Scholly: Scholarship Search does succeed in providing a targeted search and tips for kids who might otherwise have trouble getting the process started.\n

Matching upper- and lowercase letters, matching letters to their animal words, and writing freehand or with letter tiles on a drawing board all are possible activities. Kids can take the next step and unscramble letters to spell out whole animal words and can grow through multiple levels of difficulty. Once they've mastered their native language(s), they can change the language settings and learn a bit about letters and animal words in a foreign language. Preschoolers ABC Playground Pro allows both kids and grown-ups a lot of room for choice so the multiple activities and options can truly fit each kid.\n

As they read the narratives recounting the day's adventure, they'll see vivid word choice and elaboration techniques, though many of the books are basically the same, and the younger reading levels have less elaboration than the older levels. Overall, Dino Tales is a an interesting combination of adventure game and language arts practice, but it's possible that kids will want to focus more on the game component and won't bother reading the created books.\n

The words available are varied and create some fun, silly, and nonsensical sentences; however, it's sentence structure that matters here, so kids will have fun with words, empowering them to take risks when writing. Sleep Furiously is a unique way for kids to play with the components of a complete sentence and would serve as a fun reinforcement of grammar concepts or writing exercises.\n

Though the game provides rich content and plenty of positive rewards, the only feedback for incorrect answers is a big red X. Although this is intended as a practice tool, struggling kids would benefit more if they could access a hint for each worksheet. King of Math Junior is a solid math tool that addresses a wide variety of skills.\n

Though the book is informative, some of the science is presented from a definitive point of view (for example, genetically modifying food is entirely negative). Also, some kids may find the text-heaviness and abrupt transitions between the narrative and facts off-putting. Powerful Plants pulls out the stops to inject life into botany and likely will capture the imaginations of many kids; smoother transitions and some refinement would probably entice even more to learn about, grow, and perhaps even eat their vegetables.\n

22406	3232	0	3	Kids can learn vowel sounds and how they're used in words. They'll encounter short vowel sounds at the beginnings of words and in the middles of simple words. They'll see more complex, sea-related words, too, and complete a word with the correct vowel when given a picture and the beginning and end of the word. If kids use the toys, they'll get to interact with the device in a new way, which adds a layer to learning. Tiggly Submarine: Explore the Depths of Short Vowels & Phonics is a cool way for kids to see vowels in action and learn some new words.\n

22413	3233	0	2	Kids can learn about getting silly and creative. Imaginative play has an infinite number of benefits for children, including giving them practice with flexible thinking. With a mix of realistic and non-realistic options -- such as pickle boats -- kids can explore some traditional and non-traditional uses for a few familiar objects. Though with options limited to only what's been programmed by the game developers, kids will discover that playing offscreen has even more possibilities. If they tell a story about Harvey's trip, kids also can practice their verbal and vocabulary skills. Sago Mini Boats is another fun, open-ended adventure, but its learning potential without offscreen extensions is shallow.\n

22441	3237	0	4	Kids can learn about weather conditions and how they affect the environment. Through free play and exploration, kids can manipulate temperature and wind conditions and create weather scenes with nine weather conditions: sunny, partly cloudy, cloudy, rain, thunderstorm, snow, blizzard, tornado, and hurricane. Each condition includes a narrated description and allows kids to observe how the condition affects their avatar and the environment. For example, when kids choose "tornado," they learn its pronunciation and definition. A siren goes off, the avatar jumps into an underground safety area, and, as the tornado sweeps across the screen, leaves blow around and the ground gets torn up. Kids also can choose sunny skies, pleasant temperatures, and kite-flying. MarcoPolo Weather is a fun, empowering way for kids to explore outdoor conditions while appropriately introducing weather safety.\n

Plant Process animations are intended to help kids learn processes such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Because the terminology is relatively advanced and there's a lot of text, kids should have some background so the information makes sense. Also, there is some information that might reinforce misconceptions kids already have (plants eat dirt). Though not the strongest in the suite of Arloon apps, Arloon Plants does have a lot of information on offer, but it's not the most accessible and engaging choice for your budding botanist.\n

Because the story and games focus on how kids navigate increasingly complex emotions as they get older and experience stress, kids also can recognize that feelings can overlap and compete with each other. In terms of reading, kids can hone reading fluency and listening skills as they progress through the story. Inside Out: Storybook Deluxe takes kids on an emotional journey and lets them explore the elements of the movie through text, narration, and creativity.\n

The traditional moral -- slow and steady wins the race -- is presented as advice not to laugh at someone who is slower. The tortoise laughs about his victory, though, not exactly modeling the moral himself. The text is written in cursive, so kids learning cursive will get practice reading it, and the story can be read in Spanish or English. Overall, The Tortoise and the Hare | Arloon Kids is more about creative expression and technology use than reading practice or delivering a lesson in morality.\n

They'll practice early reading skills as they match items, putting the right object into the shape in the suitcase, or choosing the correctly shaped key to open the treasure chest. They'll also have some fun and express their creativity decorating sand castles and tropical drinks.

Stringing together increasingly long chains of commands -- some well over 20 steps long -- helps kids understand how sequences of steps can move a robot through complex environments. However, this approach emphasizes playful puzzle-solving and is relatively light on coding instruction or concepts. Still, as a first taste of robotics and programming, Lego Mindstorms Fix the Factory might inspire further learning.\n

Kids learn various strategies including comparing numbers, rounding up or down, and breaking numbers to make tens. Kids can practice what they learn by playing five games that are timed and scored, and two of the games can be played with partners. A more direct link between the Learning and Games sections would help kids who need more scaffolding to apply concepts, and more kid-friendly language would help kids who haven't approached math in this way before. Though it probably won't wean kids off calculators entirely, Arloon Mental Math strives to help kids do arithmetic more efficiently.\n

Provide tool names so that kids can call each tool by name, and they'll figure out that the power drill makes holes, the saw cuts, the wrench tightens bolts, and so on. They'll feel some sense of satisfaction when they see a finished product. Yet, with little logic to the building steps and no obvious connection between those steps and the final project, it may be hard for kids to see how what they're doing actually makes something. Though Sago Mini Toolbox delivers many of the features parents and kids have grown to love, it doesn't connect enough dots for kids to really learn lessons about building things.\n

On some levels they'll get a little practice strategizing and doing things in order, such as first picking fruit off a tree, then using the water to push the fruit into a little house to feed the mysterious inhabitant (who then spits the seed out the door). They can learn a bit about fire as well: If they move an object that's on fire, it can make the surroundings catch on fire. Sprinkle Junior is only intended to be low-pressure fun, but kids might learn some things about fire and water through observation and practice a little problem-solving.\n

The "on this day" approach can show kids events and people often overlooked in mainstream history classes, which may offer a fresh perspective. Linking out to other sites may inspire further research as kids dig deeper into certain stories and people. Quist isn't slick or designed to capture the hearts and minds of teens, but it does offer curated historical information that isn't always readily accessible.\n

It's presented through play, which is a great way for preschoolers to develop their language skills. They'll hear conversational instructions related to a birthday party and then respond. Kids can easily switch languages, too, from English to Spanish, Chinese, or Portuguese. Monki Birthday Party takes what kids love -- birthdays -- and adds playful learning for a fun, educational game for preschoolers.\n

The app asks them to name their emotions (angry, sad, silly, or worried) and their corresponding severity, which may help kids process situations they might normally keep inside. By writing a worry or joy on the digital paper, kids have the opportunity to focus on something concrete instead of dealing with the emotion on their own. Deep breathing as the bubble floats also may encourage kids to be mindful of their bodies and internal emotional thermostats. If used consistently, Breathing Bubbles will give kids an opportunity to manage their thoughts and feelings in a new, empowering way.\n

22651	3267	0	2	Kids can learn vocabulary words and develop reading skills by reading themselves or listening to the story, which will encourage kids who revisit the book to eventually read it independently. Most pages include a vocabulary word that kids can tap to see the word demonstrated. For example, when kids tap the word stomps, they hear it read aloud and then see the character stomp. Just as with any book -- electronic or traditional -- reading more improves reading skills, and kids are more likely to read about things they're interested in. In terms of messages, the Transformers need to work together to succeed, which emphasizes cooperation, but the gender-based messages are a bit confusing: Female characters save themselves, but the Transformers get credit. Transformers Rescue Bots: Dino Island has some fun interactive elements for emergent readers and some positive messages, but parents may want to be on-hand to highlight the females' self-reliance in the story.\n
22652	3267	1	1	Mild cartoon-violence including spraying robots with water and electricity and pushing a human.\n

22658	3268	0	3	Kids can learn to read independently and follow written instructions. They can review the words included, if necessary, by tapping the book, and then test their knowledge through the game. Beginning with level 1, kids learn words such as look, on, it, the, and ball. Each level adds a few more words, advancing to words such as beside, under, search, check, and find on level 10. Kids also will learn vocabulary related to fruits, vegetables, and animals. uKloo takes the decoding practice from leveled early readers and blends it with a simple, interactive scavenger hunt that gets kids reading for a purpose.\n

The facts are presented in a short book, and the video is a one-minute National Geographic clip that shows several kangaroos -- moms and joeys -- eating and hopping around. For the kangaroo information, kids will need to tap the owl on the start page of the game. From the game itself, kids can learn a bit of physics -- what goes up comes down, what springs do, and what fans do -- but the game itself isn't primarily educational. Overall, the National Geographic content in AJ Jump: Animal Jam Kangaroos! seems added on rather than integrated into the experience, which is mostly a just-for-fun endless jumper.\n

22674	3270	2	0	Subtle innuendos kids likely will miss -- for example, a male character finding and keeping a picture of a female character -- but it may raise questions.\n

22683	3271	4	3	There's a push to get kids to pay for in-app purchases to speed things up; pop-culture references.\n

If parents get involved, kids will work on communication and teamwork skills, as they're encouraged to share what they're doing with their parents. Yet without background explanation, kids won't learn much about the why and how of what they're being asked to do unless parents chime in or kids research on their own. Koda Quest - A Fingerprint Network App encourages kids to act beyond the app but without much context.\n

While learning to follow the laws of physics and gravity in their designs, they can learn to be creative, explore ideas, and revise. During the testing process, they'll learn what flies well and what doesn't and can tweak their crafts, allowing kids to learn from failure. Though the ads and coin-earning are distracting, with some focus kids can pick up some important skills in resilience and physics playing Hovercraft - Build Fly Retry.\n

22722	3277	1	2	The Gems punch, whip, and explode their enemies, but it's pretty mild stuff. Power gauge shows inflicted damage, and defeated enemies vanish in a beam of light.\n
22723	3277	2	0	The Gems' bodies are those of fully grown, curvy women; some families may find a positive body-image message here, though others might object. All characters are fully covered up, and their movements aren't suggestive.\n

The history and scientific principles behind the theories and laws are explained, and kids can answer questions to apply what they've learned. Kids also can read biographies of the scientists who contributed to the development of these theories and laws. Videos and graphics support the text, and the information is accurate and age-appropriate. However, the interactive elements are limited. Some hands-on lesson plans or labs would make the learning experience much more meaningful for kids. Classic Experiments in Science History FULL is a solid extension to initial learning about these scientific principles, but a more hands-on approach will ignite kids' enthusiasm further.\n

As an inroad to organizational tools, VoiceNote may be a good choice, but kids likely will need more flexibility as they shape their skills and processes.\n
22777	3285	0	1	Although BabyFirst Video was created with educational intent, we don't recommend it for learning. Babies and toddlers learn best though observing the (real) world around them and interacting with people. Passive video watching, especially for long periods, is not the best educational experience for kids under 2. BabyFirst Video does include songs and exposure to colors, letters, shapes, numbers, and social play, and parents can watch with kids and get ideas for real-world experiences, but it's not a stand-alone teaching tool for babies.\n

As they advance through the activities, they'll have to skip numbers, learning that they need to add two to one to get to three, for example. With Tiggly Addventure: Number Line & Math Learning Game for Preschool, kids can begin to develop a foundation in number sense or how numbers relate to each other.\n

They'll count objects and add them to recipes, and they can use the toys or multiple fingers to group sets of ingredients, which can improve number sense. Kids also have the opportunity to use their imaginations, creating their own crazy concoctions and then making them, extending their creativity and the application of what they've learned. As an added learning opportunity, kids will learn the names of foods -- fruits, vegetables, and other ingredients that may or may not be familiar to them, such as kiwi and shrimp. Tiggly Chef: Preschool Math Cooking Game brings some good, silly fun to counting and addition.\n

Because of its simple design, Happy Timer - Handy Timer can help kids gain independence in setting time limits.\n

22856	3296	2	1	All users under 18 must be fully clothed/covered, but users older than 18 can appear topless. Because live streaming is unpredictable, it's possible users will share sexual content. During the review period, we saw teen boys without shirts dancing provactively.\n
22857	3296	3	4	Profanity is rampant in broadcasts and comments. Bullying and sexually explicit language aren't allowed, though "f--k" is used frequently.\n

22861	3297	0	3	Kids can learn about geology, mining, crafting, construction, and conservation. A world ripe for transformation allows players to experiment and see how different materials can be harvested and used to create objects useful to human existence. Astute players also may recognize how, with the passage of time, their relentless expansion leads to a resource-depleted setting. Through its open-ended environment and almost limitless play options, Terraria offers opportunities for exploration, problem solving, strategy, deduction, and collaboration. \n
22862	3297	1	3	Monsters -- floating eyes, zombies, worms -- attack the player's character regularly. Kids can choose either to flee or to attack with swords, bows, and magic. Attacks sometimes result in tiny square bits of blood being shed. Should the player's avatar die, he or she will leave behind a tombstone with an inscription that might embellish the circumstances of the death, suggesting, for example, that the hero's face was "ripped off." Player-vs.-player mode allows users to kill each other in-game as well.\n

22868	3298	0	4	Kids can learn about different topics related to each edition. For example, in the free edition, kids are inspired through reading and gameplay to learn about the fall season, scarecrows, pumpkins, trees, falling leaves, and more. The stories range in difficulty level and include a rebus story (wherein pictures represent words), a short poem, and longer stories. Kids can follow along with the highlighted text or they can record their own voices reading the story. The hidden-picture puzzles are fun and encourage visual awareness while helping to improve observation and matching skills. Though the drawing and video activities inspire creativity, some of the video activities seem out of place. For example, one Brain Play video asks kids to think about three things they like to know about their friends. Overall, Highlights: All About offers a wide variety of learning activities that allow kids to engage with topics from many angles and skill levels.\n

22889	3301	0	2	Kids can learn about helping others and rudimentary medical treatment in a playful setting, making the idea of physical injuries less scary. Most notably, Doc is a character who helps others and works with a team, which sets a strong example. The medical treatment, which is often toy-specific and doesn't apply to people, is secondary. However, kids can learn to use tweezers to remove splinters and other small objects from the skin. As kids help guide Doc through the bicycle trail, they also practice motor skills and the use of technology. Doc McStuffins: Mobile Clinic Rescue is engaging for kids, but its mission is fun, not learning.\n

22903	3303	0	4	Kids can learn physics concepts such as buoyancy, force, gravity, and synchronizing movements -- without the vocabulary. They'll learn hands-on as they try out techniques, sometimes fail, and then try something new. Failure is integral to the learning design, and there's no penalty, which helps kids develop resilience and is integral to lifelong learning. Kids can restart and replay as many times as necessary. Help isn't offered, either, allowing kids to problem-solve and discover on their own.Thinkrolls 2 packs solid science concepts and important learning skills into a beautifully designed game kids will want to play over and over again.\n

22931	3307	0	3	Kids can learn the characteristics of 27 solid figures, including the numbers of sides, edges, and vertices. By rotating each shape and making it transparent, they can gain an understanding of the shape's three-dimensional nature. Kids also can unfold the shapes to reveal their nets and study the two-dimensional figures that make up the three-dimensional figures. For example, when a quadrilateral pyramid is unfolded, the net reveals that this solid figure is made of a square and four triangles. Kids can further investigate by making their own nets. The cylinder and cone do not have nets, so adding these would be helpful. Also, the app misses an opportunity to assess learning or set objectives, so the addition of challenges or mini games could extend the learning experience. Overall, Shapes - 3D Geometry Learning is simple on the surface but can be unfolded to reveal lots of learning opportunities.\n

By protecting their plants from pests and growing different kinds of vegetables, they'll learn about healthy eating. Kids will feel proud and empowered when they pick the fully grown veggies and feed them to the animals.

A step-by-step tutorial introduces the clock, its numbers, the big hand and the little hand, and how to put it all together. Then, there's lots of practice through a game, a drill set, and an interactive book. Kids also can get a sense of what different times mean and how time passes throughout the day as they read about the Smurfs' daily schedule. Kids could learn more problem-solving skills if the help button provided clues to the solution rather than jumping immediately to showing the right answer. Overall,Telling Time with the Smurfs teaches kids the basics of telling time, and the duller elements won't bother a true Smurfs fan.\n

Math learning depends on how kids approach the game: If they just use trial and error and matching to build, the amount of math they pick up may be minimal. Grown-ups can help by guiding kids to make the math content more explicit in lower levels. In terms of learning potential, Odd Squad: Blob Chase offers problem-solving opportunities and some math concepts within the wacky world of the Odd Squad.\n

They'll stretch their short-term memories in the classic memory game -- here with presents hidden in gift boxes. And they'll explore balance and spatial sense as they stack boxes of different sizes so they don't topple over. Yet, the light learning content only scratches the surface. Yo Gabba Gabba!

The learning content has channels that directly instruct kids in certain areas such as number sense, computation, reading, and days of the week. Content in other areas also has learning potential; for example, Reading Rainbow and Sesame Street help teach letter recognition and reading. There's also a lot of non-educational content available, as well. Bottom line? YouTube Kids definitely has content that facilitates learning, but with so much to choose from, parents might have to specifically steer kids toward that content to make it happen.\n
23002	3317	1	1	Mild cartoon violence in some clips. Some potentially creepy images for younger viewers, as in "Figaro Pho," which features a character who faces phobias and is drawn in a Tim Burton-y style. Curated content updated periodically, so degrees of violence and scariness may fluctuate. Also, sometimes scary images are embedded in what at first seem to be kid-friendly videos (for example, some videos at Vids4kids.tv).\n
23003	3317	2	1	Curated videos updated periodically. Presence of potentially inappropriate content may fluctuate; parents have reported videos containing racy and explicit images (from crotch grabbing during a Michael Jackson dance tutorial to nudity).\n

The videos featuring branded content aren't marked as advertising and are mixed in with other videos; also, parents have reported seeing occasional ads with inappropriate content. Some videos are completely focused on products such as backpacks and toy sets, often titled and filed under the term "Unbox It" (for example, a video on the Brick Queen channel features the unboxing of a Pokémon toy). Other examples of branded content include videos featuring Disney dolls and Hasbro products, as well as whole channels from brands such as McDonald's (which features, among other things, videos about Happy Meal toys). A YouTube Red subscription eliminates ads.\n

Each puzzle may have multiple solutions and may require a few tries before kids get a bridge or set of stairs set up so Cat can get out. Most of all, by having fun with math concepts in the casual and engaging setting of Peg + Cat = The Tree Problem, kids can learn that math is fun and exciting. \n

23043	3323	0	5	Snapchat is extremely easy to set up and use. Users create a unique Snapchat account and add friends by linking to their phone’s address book, connecting to Facebook, or entering specific Snapchat usernames. To send a message, users snap a picture with the in-app camera (or type a text message), set the length of time the photo will display, select recipients, and send. Users can see a list of sent and received messages and can see if messages were opened. In addition, users who are using the app at the same time can initiate a private teleconference.\n

23065	3326	1	2	Filled with the same sort of cartoon violence you'd find in a Looney Tunes cartoon on TV. Elmer Fudd fires a gun frequently (always missing), and there are dustup fights when you hit too many obstacles (dust balls with stars and an occasional limb showing). \n

23078	3328	0	5	Play is super easy as kids simply tap around the screen and watch what happens. Tapping and dragging across the screen gives kids more control over Jinja's movements, but Jinja also will just move on her own to wherever kids tap. \n
23079	3328	1	2	Kids can learn a few simple things about how to interact with a touchscreen and what it can do as they practice tapping and dragging. As kids observe what happens when they touch certain parts of the screen, they also explore cause and effect: When I tap that, this happens. They may want to follow up to learn the stories behind the characters. If they make up their own stories, they'll also exercise language skills as they narrate what's going on, but this will likely only happen with parent involvement; the app doesn't encourage this on its own. The open-ended and inviting world of Sago Mini Fairy Tales will definitely entice toddlers, and parents can extend learning opportunities beyond what's offered on the screen.\n

Along the way, they can access a large variety of tools that allow them to alter the world of the game. In Disney Infinity: Toy Box 2.0, kids use their imaginations and logic to meet their goals faster and have fun while doing it.\n
23086	3329	1	3	Cartoon violence from a wide variety of Disney characters -- including some (such as Tinker Bell) whom you might not expect to see in a fight (or losing one). Violence includes fistfights and the use of weapons (Tinker Bell uses her wand to battle evil robots), but there is no blood. When characters lose battles, they break apart into pieces.\n

23092	3330	0	4	The majority of the activities are well explained and user-friendly. One possible frustration is that parents need to download and unlock games before kids can play them. Also, game titles and information appear for only a few seconds before vanishing. Parents who want to scroll through what's available will have to keep pressing a little "i" icon over and over.\n
23148	3338	0	2	Kids can learn the importance of government in a society and the difficulty that comes with making decisions as a leader. Do you build a sewer plant that gets the job done but upsets citizens or put up with sanitation issues until you can afford a bio-friendly plant? Do you build parks or earmark that money for industry? Decisions have consequences in SimCity BuildIt, which offers a bird's-eye view of the many tough choices a government has to make. \n
23149	3338	1	2	Houses can burn down, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, can wipe out parts of town. \n
23093	3330	1	4	Kids can learn lots of math and reading skills and get a sprinkling of other knowledge. From counting, spelling, and shapes to self-care skills such as tooth brushing and getting dressed, there's a lot here. Most games have solid learning content and address important early math and reading skills. However, a few confusing games might get in the way. Kids might feel a little frustrated with the narrow play options available to them when they start, but as they play more options will open up. TopIQ Math, Reading & Writing Learning Program for Kids in Preschool, Kindergarten & 1st Grade provides a wealth of content and individualized learning potential, but parents might want to begin with the free trial before subscribing to make sure it's right for their kid.\n

They can either use in-app features such as swiping and tapping, or they can draw paper-and-pencil sketches on printable grids and scan them in using the device's camera. Kids will enjoy seeing their creations in action and sharing them with the community in Arcade mode, where they can learn what works and what doesn't. Adventure Time Game Wizard - Draw Your Own Adventure Time Games inspires creativity and empowers kids to choose their own gameplay mode and share their creations.\n

23113	3333	0	4	Kids can learn problem solving and get practice with three basic cognitive skills: attention (hide and seek), sorting (by color and shape), and visual motor coordination (guide creatures to eat only matching colored dots). As kids play, the task gets more challenging (for example, find two hiding monsters rather than one), so kids gradually build on skills. As kids learn through trial and error, there is no penalty for wrong answers and lots of celebration when they get it right. LumiKids Park by Lumosity, Early Learning Play for Kids is a high-caliber tool that lets kids practice basic skills while adapting to their responses and sending parents optional progress-tracking emails -- all for free.\n

They also can work on their observation and data-collection skills to track guests' reactions to each food to discover each diner's personal preferences. Why does this guest like one food but not another? How can kids make a food so their guests will enjoy it? Add spices? Combine it with another food? The satisfaction they feel from seeing the results of their creative combinations in Toca Kitchen 2 may inspire kids to explore with food and cooking in the real kitchen. \n

They'll develop vocabulary and critical-thinking skills by deciphering the meaning of the words and phrases as well as the themes of the poems. The app includes the poems and readings only, with no background or analysis, so parents may want to supplement with discussions. The Sonnets, by Shakespeare is essentially an ebook that makes the sonnets accessible for reading or listening.\n

23141	3337	0	2	Kids can learn about number strategy and practice their problem-solving skills. Although Just Get 10 does not teach kids a lot about math, parents can use it to encourage kids to think about numbers and the importance of strategizing. The overall layout and goal of the game are unique, but it would be great to see some more mathematical content integrated into gameplay. For example, rather than tapping tiles to get to the next number (from 1 to 2, and then from 2 to 3, and so on) kids could tap tiles to reach a particular sum or difference. Just Get 10 does offer kids an opportunity to think through a problem and establish a process, but the game's limitations likely will stymie enthusiasm.\n

23160	3339	5	1	No outright restriction on posting about drinking, drugs, or smoking, but the topic is rare in posts, possibly due to moderation for potential illegal activity.\n

23162	3340	0	3	Kids can learn how to use social media safely and wisely working alongside a parent. Though GeckoLife was not designed specifically with educational intent, parents can use it to model good social-networking manners and help kids develop smart social-networking skills in a safe environment. It'd be great to see a few videos or tutorials in the app to reinforce digital citizenship to kids. Overall, GeckoLife gives kids a safe platform to develop social media skills.\n

23176	3342	0	2	Kids can learn tidbits of history and develop an understanding of the time line of periods of U.S. history. The games are loosely based on particular periods, especially Early American, Colonial, American Revolution, frontier times, and the Gold Rush. The Did You Know facts and videos about each period deliver the most educational content. However, the history presented is centered mostly on the white male experience, missing the role of women and people of color. Overall, Frontier Heroes is designed more for entertainment than education, though kids may find a few history takeaways or a spark of interest in U.S. history.\n
23177	3342	1	1	Cartoon-like violence representing historical events. Native Americans target-shoot. Boston Tea Partiers throw tea off boat but get bonus points for hitting a Red Coat. Two men get hit by a train if they don't move fast enough.\n

They'll also be able to make inferences about the people based on what they see in the homes: how they spend free time, how they do chores, and the conveniences they enjoy. The handbook offers more detail about the homes, the culture, and the architecture as well as through-provoking questions that parents can use as learning tools. Using the tags in different languages, kids also can practice learning another language or develop their vocabulary.

How about birch? Or deep lakes or tall mountains? As they experiment with which animals will eat which of five foods, kids also learn a bit about animal diets. Most of all, kids will be inspired by the magic of nature, watching bears ramble about and birds flitter through the trees. In its own warm, quiet way, Toca Nature lets kids discover their own understanding of nature's wonders as they explore and experiment.\n

23233	3350	1	4	Kids can learn and practice important cognitive function skills such as memory, flexible thinking, self-control, reasoning, and attention. Kids work on these skills by repeating back increasingly longer sequences, continuing increasingly more complex patterns, and sorting according to ever-changing rules and conditions. Instruction is often minimal, so kids must also use logic and deductive reasoning (aka trial and error) to uncover the rules of the game. Thinking Time Pro is a great workout for young brains, developing important but sometimes left-behind cognitive skills. \n

23256	3353	3	5	Posts are filled with harsh language, racist and sexist language, and every curse word imaginable to the point that it's difficult to get a screenshot without including the word "f--k."\n

23258	3353	5	5	Much of the posted content is from parties, including lots of drinking and some drug use. One image is of a toddler who appears to be smoking marijuana, captioned with a racial slur.\n

23260	3354	0	4	Kids can learn physics concepts such as buoyancy, Newtonian principles, and synchronizing movements without the vocabulary. They'll learn hands-on as they try out techniques, sometimes fail, and then try something new. Failure is integral to the learning design, and there's no penalty. Kids can restart and replay as many times as necessary. Help isn't offered, either, allowing kids to problem-solve and discover on their own. Thinkrolls packs solid science concepts and important learning skills into a beautifully designed game kids will want to play over and over.\n

Solving the puzzles also requires attention to detail and task persistence, especially as the grids get bigger. With all levels available to choose from, kids also are able to test their own limits as they experiment with finding the right-size grid. Kids explore a bit about musical notes, but the music theme is underdeveloped. Domi Domi Blocks is a simple, well-designed introduction to puzzles for kids. \n

23295	3359	0	4	With multiple difficulty levels and a wide range of control options, this is an easy game for any kid to start playing. Some parts of the game -- such as boss fights -- are a little harder than others, but the more Skylanders characters kids have, the easier it is to make it through these slightly trickier spots. The new ability to swap to a captured villain with the tap of a button gives players another way to avoid defeat.\n
23296	3359	1	3	Players use swords, bows, guns, hammers, punches, kicks, and magic to attack a variety of fantastical creatures. Defeated enemies fall to the ground and quickly disappear. Skylanders never die but do need to rest until recovered. The violence is all cartoonish, though, and contains no blood or gore.\n

23299	3359	4	5	Although the app is free, players can only play a trial level before needing to purchase the retail "starter kit," which contains physical Skylander toys and a portal that lets you "insert" them into the game. The starter kit costs $75, and the spending doesn't stop there. The game encourages players to purchase toys, including Skylanders figurines and Trap crystals, to enhance the experience -- and, although they're not required to complete the game, they greatly enhance it. Characters from previous Skylanders games are supported, but they're less useful this time. Special Trap Master characters and Trap crystals are necessary in order to unlock secret areas and use villain characters to complete special quests. It's easy to spend hundreds of dollars on the game. \n

Mini-activities cover the skills and can be found within each "Planet," and kids must complete a level within a planet to get to the next level. Difficulty increases as kids play, even within a single mini-activity. For example, in a bubble-popping activity about numbers, kids start by popping the bubbles in chronological order. Then, they pop bubbles that are "greater than" or "less than" a given number. In the Math Fact section, kids focus on building fact fluency. They choose a mathematical operation and try to complete drills as quickly and accurately as possible. Kids do not receive feedback for incorrect answers, so 1st Grade Math Planet – Fun Math Game Curriculum is best suited for targeted practice rather than full curriculum support.\n

They have the opportunity to think about other people's experiences and feelings, especially in the context of often complex teen social lives. Characters can be customized with skin tone, hair color, face, and clothes, but the game reinforces stereotypes by grouping them by "type" such as jocks, nerds, preps, cheerleaders, and so on, without much nuance. Quests often require certain types of characters to compete. High School Story touches on themes such as bullying, fitting in, gossip, and being yourself and may challenge kids to work on their empathy. \n
23324	3363	1	1	There's no on-screen violence (it's text-based), but characters occasionally get in physical fights and don't always control their anger well. There is some emotional violence during bullying storylines. \n

Different activities work on preschool-level thinking skills such as sorting items found in the plane into the recycle bin or into the Lost and Found box or connecting cables by matching colors. Kids are having fun and learning as they play. The activities don't go into much depth or increase in challenge as kids play, though. Overall, Baby Airlines - Airport City Adventures is a preschool-friendly game mostly focused on fun and exploration -- which is how kids learn -- but with little room for creativity or challenge.\n

Players need to analyze each tower and evaluate their birds' abilities before setting out to demolish structures in as efficient a manner as possible. Kids also can use momentum to make objects slam into each other and cause destructive chain reactions. Angry Birds Stella lets kids observe real-world physics concepts through hands-on, trial-and-error puzzle solving.\n
23401	3374	1	2	When birds make contact with an obstacle, they disappear in a tuft of feathers, but they demonstrate no pain and seem perfectly willing participants in the mayhem.

23408	3375	1	4	The entire point of the game is kill or be killed. Players will shoot either the avatars of other players in live death matches or compete against artificial intelligence enemies. When they're hit, the screen flashes with red. It's worth noting the graphics in the game are very blocky, so the impact of the violence is muted somewhat. \n
23409	3375	2	2	Players can create their own "skins" for their avatars, opening up a potential Pandora's box of questionable content. \n

By dragging and dropping characters onto a stage and adding simple action, little programmers can bring simple, lightly interactive scenes to life. The Lego-like, snap-together commands make the basic programs easy to create, but the multiple trays, editors, and input screens take some getting used to. Watching and learning from the effects of their programming choices will help kids make decisions about how to craft their next program, and the customization options will engage their creativity. Ultimately, ScratchJr offers a rich and challenging environment for very young programmers.\n \n

23425	3377	4	3	Kids can learn to use their imaginations and role-play with Dr. Panda's Bus Driver. They also can learn a little about vehicle maintenance, geography, and social skills, especially with help and support from parents. Kids could learn more if their choices had some effect (for example, the bus stops if they choose not to stop for gas; they damage the tires if they don't slow down for the speed bump; the bus runs off the road if they don't steer; passengers get upset if kids don't let them cross the street). Dr. Panda's Bus Driver is a fun way for kids to role-play an everyday activity, and playing with parents is a great way to boost learning.\n

Kids don't get penalized for wrong answers; instead they simply keep trying until they make the right choice. The games also introduce a good number of tool and building vocabulary words (level, wrench, and so on) and show some building techniques (for example, cutting a board with a jigsaw). Even though the activities feel disjointed and unrelated to each other, kids will get practice and exposure to building vocabulary and working with numbers.\n

23442	3380	0	4	Kids can learn and build fluency in several content areas including addition, subtraction, number sense, place value, estimation, geometry, and telling time. The game features mini-activities within each planet, and kids have to complete a level within a planet to get to the next level. There is solid learning progression throughout the game, even within the mini-activities. For example, in one mini-activity, kids start by counting jellybeans. Then they identify which table has more jellybeans on it. Finally, kids drag jellybeans onto a table to finish number sentences involving addition and subtraction. The game also features a Math Facts section. Kids choose a specific topic and then race to complete drills with both speed and accuracy. Although feedback for incorrect answers is lacking, 2nd Grade Math Planet is a great way for kids to practice and boost fluency in key areas of mathematics.\n

23450	3381	1	5	Kids can learn and get lots of practice in focusing on a task, persisting through completion, listening to directions, doing things in sequences, problem solving, remembering rules, and exercising self-control. These are all extremely important school-readiness skills that can help kids be more successful learners. Pairing the digital exercises with offline learning extensions such as those listed in the parents' section can give an even greater learning boost.

The diagrams help kids visualize locations of internal body structures, and being able to tap and read about a structure is extremely convenient. There's a lot of content for kids to learn, but most of it is nicely organized by body system. Kids can take multiple-choice quizzes to assess learning, but the quizzes contain numerous grammatical errors, which can be distracting. This interactive, content-rich reference tool is an excellent resource for kids studying human anatomy and physiology.\n

It's straightforward practice with no feedback, though, so kids need to be self-motivated and reflective to figure out why they were wrong and then find the right answer. Once kids get started, they won't want to stop, making Quento a nice option for daily addition and subtraction practice.\n

However, testing their brains to see the neuroscience of the Stroop effect could open up conversations about science, experiments, and observation. Either way, the challenge is pretty fun, if occasionally frustrating, and kids may improve their ability to focus using True Color.\n

The addition and subtraction problems include facts for numbers 0 through 20, and the multiplication and division problems cover facts for numbers 0 through 12. Kids practice their skills by completing missions that require speed and accuracy. The games are not instructional, and there's no feedback for incorrect answers, so kids should have prior experience in arithmetic. This app offers kids engaging math practice with an interesting spy-themed twist.\n

Kids can move around the various parts of the spacecraft as they wish, and each area focuses on a different skill set. For example, in the biology lab, kids work with place value. In the robot lab, they work with angle measures, parallel and perpendicular lines, and 3-D shapes. Kids are not penalized for getting answers wrong, but they must correctly answer a certain number of problems before completing a mission. Each mission has three levels of difficulty, so kids are challenged as they continue to play. SMART Adventures Mission Math 1: Sabotage at the Space Station is a good way to practice core math skills with mini-games and an engaging story line.\n

Kids are in control of what Toto does and when he does it, a fun and meaningful experience for little ones learning to take responsibility for their own routines. Through play, kids also develop social and verbal skills. Parents can play alongside little ones, talking about what they're doing and making connections to their own lives. Kids also can learn empathy as they take on the role of Toto, seeing and offering what he wants or needs. Dr. Panda & Toto's Treehouse is a fun and age-appropriate way for young kids to explore and learn about routines.\n

23562	3397	1	1	Some quotes include violent undertones. One jokes that if you give a man a match, he'll be warm for a short period, but if you set him on fire, he'll be warm for years. An uncredited quote from Hannibal Lector of Silence of the Lambs mentions eating a man's liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.\n
23563	3397	2	2	Humorous quotes used for typing practice contain some sexual innuendo. Quotes from comedians such as George Carlin and Bill Maher are a bit racy. One quote from Bill Maher insinuates that Madonna has more than 10 people in her bed in a week, and one from Paris Hilton mentions a "money shot" and taking her top off.\n
23564	3397	3	2	Some quotes include insults, such "crazy" and "stupid," as well as several misogynistic sentences: "If a man is standing in the middle of the forest speaking, and there is no woman around to hear him, is he still wrong?" Words such as "hell" also appear in some quotes.\n
23565	3397	4	2	Kids can learn to type quickly and accurately on a touchscreen device such as an iPad or Android tablet. Though keyboarding skills are still important, the ubiquitousness of touchscreens means kids need to develop speed and accuracy with them as well. Kids won't learn hand formation or the placement of the keys, but they will practice typing short pieces -- witty and informative sentences and short paragraphs -- with perfect accuracy and then see their WPM score. Though the frequent ads disrupt the process, kids will have fun practicing with Type Racer and will get motivation from seeing their speeds improve.\n

By building their own rockets, kids can develop an understanding of how different parts work to complete a task, as well as how the parts work together as a system. When kids launch rockets from different planets, they learn how variations in atmosphere and gravity affect orbital motion. The challenge mode in SimpleRockets motivates and empowers kids as they try to fly their rockets the fastest and farthest, safely land on the moon, use the least amount of fuel, and more.\n

Since there's no wrong way to interact with the app, kids can test limits and experiment: How many scoops can fit on this cone?

23589	3401	0	2	Kids can learn to follow directions and think critically completing puzzles, matching shapes, and identifying objects. They'll also learn a bit about dinosaurs, undersea animals, and cooking, though not with much depth beyond the names of the animals or foods. The skills focus is on visual discrimination -- matching the shapes of objects, be it shapes of foods or dinosaur bones, or matching verbal descriptions to the sea animals. Though the title stresses pretend play, Caillou Let's Pretend is more about following directions and visual discrimination than imaginative play.\n

But, without some context and possibly some guidance and encouragement, young players may get stuck long before they internalize some of the key lessons of programming. Also, when compared to the many learn-to-program titles on the market, Lightbot Jr only scratches the surface. This is a fine introduction to programming concepts for young kids, but, for a deeper dive into coding, kids will have to look elsewhere.\n

Kids tilt the device to bounce the star so it lands on the correct place on a number line. For example, if the star has the fraction "1/2" written on it, kids bounce the star at the halfway point on the number line. If they get it wrong, they get great feedback.

23673	3413	0	2	Kids can learn how to navigate a fast-paced game by playing Astroblast Rocket Rush, yet only if it's at the right speed for preschoolers. As kids watch their energy meters go up when they collect energy orbs and then reduce as they use the energy to propel the spaceship, they get a tiny glimpse into the basics of energy input and output. With some help, kids can increase their vocabularies by naming the different obstacles (some space-related, some everyday objects). As kids view their high scores, they can name the number and watch it increase. With parent prompting, preschoolers may be able to identify how much the new high score has increased from the last high score. Astroblast Rocket Rush is fast-paced fun with a stardusting of learning.\n

On the surface, Facetune may seem like one of the hot selfie-improvement apps, but it really goes deeper into exposing teens to concepts of focus, filters, ratios, cropping, and more. Video tutorials demonstrate how to use each tool, and hands-on demo photos guide teens through the editing photos. Since Facetune can be used on any photo -- not only selfies or group shots -- kids can see the impact even subtle changes of focus or background can have. The name of the app emphasizes "face," but Facetune​ has the potential to be a great intro editing tool for general photography.\n

Kids can listen live to the service's hourly news report, browse news and culture stories, and create a custom playlist of interesting content. They can learn about international issues as well as U.S.-based news, and some of the specific programs focus on topics such as economics, science, and culture. Text and audio can be easily saved for offline use, making it easy to stay informed with or without Internet access. It's exciting to be able to listen to, read, and view stories that take the radio giant's audio content into a rich, expanded visual format.\n

They can learn to accept other's differences, to calm themselves when they're afraid, to try new foods, how to apologize, and more. Yo Gabba Gabba!

Those are pretty advanced concepts for young kids, but, through play, they'll absorb those important skills that will help them both academically and in life. Since they aren't working against a timer or an opponent, either, kids are able to take their time to think through their options. Lipa Train can help kids develop important thinking and planning skills -- skills they'll need throughout life.\n

Exposure to words in their prereading years directly impacts how well and how easily kids learn to read, so the more parents interact and talk with babies and toddlers, the more they're teaching them. PBS Parents Play & Learn gives parents easy access to ideas for ways to interact with kids, introducing them to the world around them.\n

23830	3435	3	2	Some lists from songs and movies contain inappropriate language. For example, a list from Monty Python's "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" contains the word s--t. Teens can also type in inappropriate words.\n
23831	3435	4	3	Kids can learn to recognize and define English words they use in everyday conversation. This includes words from popular movies, books and songs (but may also include inappropriate language!). Definitions go beyond the standard dictionary definitions and focus on real-world meanings and popular connotations, meaning it's not necessarily the place to find very formal defintions. Points, advancing through levels, and positive praise keep teens motivated to play until they've mastered their lists. Opportunities to connect with other users or share milestones through social media help get friends and family cheering them on as well. For kids hoping to improve their English and speak in a casual manner, Vocabla's great, but its loose style makes it just a piece of the puzzle for full language learning. \n

The adaptive format helps ensure that kids see words that fit their learning levels and don't provide too much of a challenge. All types of words help them build their vocabulary skills by teaching them to recognize spelling patterns, similar words, and definitions and by using context clues to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words. These skills will help them build their scores within the game and identify words outside the app. Vocabulary.com's game-style learning should hook kids into becoming well-spoken wordsmiths in no time. \n

One feature includes a rapid-fire, card-deck like set of images that users simply swipe right to save or left to pass on and then quickly view other products similar to those selected preferences. Searching for specific items is easy, too. Purchasing products is as simple as tapping "Buy," then you're instantly moved to the online store of the brand or supplier of the product where you're then working directly with the store, not Wanelo. When the purchase is complete, it's very easy to go back to Wanelo from the store site for more browsing.\n

With the app's spooky background music, stained pages, and creepy animations, kids will begin to appreciate Poe's masterful writing, although, as the app warns kids at the beginning, walking through the dark path of Poe's stories "may produce undesirable effects on (their) mental health or mood." This illustrated app is a fun way to introduce kids to Poe, but it lacks reading supports or opportunities for critical thinking.\n

This app features brief animations to illustrate common phrasal verbs such as "move on" and "stay up." Each animation features the Amazing Phraso, a mustachioed Victorian-era circus performer who "looks for" his glasses, "lines up" tickets, and "meets up" with a friend. Kids can learn about phrasal verbs through reading detailed instructions, exploring definitions in "Phrasal Verb View," or choosing the right construction from a list in the exercises section. Although Phrasal Verbs Machine lends itself to a drill-and-kill style of repetition, its appealing animations and extensive explanatory text make it a solid choice for boosting vocabulary.\n

Kids get a flat version of a 3-D shape and must rotate and swipe its sides to build a 3-D shape. For example, kids may get a 2-D shape made up of three squares and two triangles. By swiping the sides of this shape, kids can build a 3-D triangular prism. A picture in the top-right corner of the screen tells kids what the 3-D shape, or building, should look like. As the game gets harder, kids get several 2-D shapes and have to choose which ones will form the final 3-D shape. Kids also have to decide how to arrange the 3-D shapes so they look like the picture of the building. Cyberchase 3D Builder is a great way for kids to develop spatial-reasoning skills.\n

Learning is fun and engaging, as it's incorporated into the challenge of clearing a path for a mammoth. Kids have to slice shapes into a specific number of parts and strategically drop the parts so they crush obstacles in the mammoth's path. But be careful -- if kids drop too many parts, the path will not be adequately cleared, and they'll have to start over. Slice Fractions is a fun, innovative way to help kids build a strong conceptual understanding of fractions.\n

Kids have to analyze the flight paths of two or more planes and determine how to get the planes to merge into a single path and land within a safe distance from each other. The key is to figure out whether to change a plane's flight path (distance) or rate and by how much. If kids change one factor by too much or too little, the planes will not land efficiently.

Through gameplay, kids explore the properties and relationships of geometric shapes and concepts including congruency, line segments, triangles, quadrilaterals, circles, pairs of angles, and parallel and transverse lines. Each level progresses to a new concept that builds on the previous level. For example, kids learn the definition of a triangle in the first level by tapping three vertices to draw the three sides of a triangle. In later levels, kids learn about isosceles and equilateral triangles by exploring their side lengths. The critters in the puzzles that kids need to set free and collect appear in the same general forms of the shapes that kids need to identify. This may not be obvious to some kids, so pointing this out could be helpful. DragonBox Elements is a fun and innovative way to help kids build fundamental geometry skills.\n

Learning isn't baked in to every aspect of play but comes in pit stop breaks where kids take care of the car while answering math problems. The challenge level increases as kids master earlier concepts. They'll start with identifying numbers, move into adding one, and then ease into addition. There are no rewards for math mastery, but kids have to answer the problems to get back to the race.

They start by learning basic skills as they tap objects to make them disappear so the dragon in the box is alone on the screen. As learning progresses, kids have to isolate the box (which later becomes a variable) on one side of the screen. The key to success is that kids have to do the same thing to both sides of the screen, which models an equation. Advanced chapters incorporate fractions, coefficients, and more. Kids build a strong foundation for algebra by learning the underlying concepts for solving equations with this extremely fun and educational math app.\n

Players who wish to clothe their Spider-Man in the popular Symbiote Spidey and Iron Spider costumes will have to purchase them separately for $7.99 and $14.99 each, respectively. The app also serves as a promotional vehicle for the recent film release. \n

24065	3469	0	2	Kids can learn the very basics about the steps of veterinary diagnosis and treatment. They can follow directions, make decisions, and feel empathy for their puppy patients. As kids read and follow the directions for caring for the puppies and follow the checklist on the checkup, they're applying information and making decisions to restore the puppies' health. There's not much adaptation, and the app's interactivity is quite rigid, especially without in-app purchases; once kids choose, the app pretty much takes over the completion of the action. Still, Puppy Doctor is a fun way for kids to learn a bit about what vets do and what sort of care puppies need to be healthy.\n

Since the edit option is always available, kids can really see how writing is an ongoing process. Spelling is fixed using auto-correct, so kids can see the correct spellings of words (when the spelling checker chooses the right word). They can share their writing and get feedback from their readers, too. Lego Friends Story Maker is a fun, easy way for kids to publish their writing.\n

Still, kids learn by doing, exploring, and observing and need plenty of interaction for that; having an adult who can help kids transfer what they're learning from the TV shows to their real lives will boost their learning. The games are engaging and educational, and, through these, kids can strengthen early literacy skills. PlayKids | Videos and Educational Games for Kids and Toddlers! puts quality shows and games in an easily accessible format for the youngest app users.\n

The interactive reader will engage them as they hear the words and see them on the page, developing early reading literacy. Toddlers will become comfortable with using a device to read an age-appropriate book as they turn pages and interact with elements. Kids can also explore other languages by changing the settings to Spanish, French, or German. Wake Up Mo! ~ 3D Interactive Pop-Up Book is a colorful, engaging book for kids and parents to share as they work on developing morning routines.\n

Kids learn through play, and Dr. Panda's Toy Cars gives kids an open-play environment to practice different roles, see cause and effect, and explore different parts of a community. Through play, kids pick up literacy skills, social skills, and critical-thinking skills as they try out different scenarios. Dr. Panda's Toy Cars helps kids learn about community heroes through role-play, which is a great way for young kids to learn.\n

They'll see how the foods look when chopped or sliced with a grater or chopped in a food processor. They'll learn how the foods react to different cooking methods -- pan frying, boiling in water, stir frying in a wok, or baking in an oven. They can get creative and try new combinations without fear of failure as it's all in fun -- and some goofy concoctions get appropriately goofy responses from the customers. Kids will have a blast and learn their way around the kitchen playing Dr. Panda's Restaurant 2.\n

They'll practice matching skills as they pollinate flowers, take care of elephants, and feed raccoons. They'll learn vocabulary like omnivore and pollinate, and they'll practice decision-making as they play the mini-games. The app teaches kids hands-on how bees pollinate flowers, how elephants keep cool, clean, and bug free, and the foods that omnivore raccoons eat. Wild Kratts Creature Power does a beautiful job of combining fun with high-interest material and delivering it in a way that kids will remember.\n

They'll also see a variety of instruments -- maracas, xylophones, drums, guitars, and cymbals, for example, and hear the sounds they make. Animal Band ~3D Interactive Music Toy isn't a deep learning experience, but it may help kids develop music appreciation and early literacy skills.\n

Kids have to observe the board and strategically decide what their next move should be. Choosing poorly can reduce playtime. Yes, it's important to match up easy pairs, but you must also keep an eye on the bigger picture, attempting to reach the game's chief goal of hitting 2048 -- something that's not easy to do.  2048 is a fun puzzler in which kids can practice strategic planning -- and some basic number facts to boot.\n

The party games themselves aren't explicitly educational, but kids practice taking turns, playing multiplayer games or alone. They'll also be able to work through the emotions involved with winning and losing both from seeing the way the characters respond to losing and by talking it through with a parent as they play. Parents may need to explain some of the vocabulary differences in British English -- like parcel.  Peppa Pig's Party Time is fun to play, and since parents and kids can play together, parents can use it to open up conversations with preschoolers about party behavior and winning and losing.\n

They'll learn about healthy fruits and vegetables, where they grow, and how to eat them. They can overcome their fear of the dark by seeing that what seems scary in the dark is not threatening at all in the light. Parents can boost kids' learning with Duckie Deck Collection by playing alongside them, talking to them, and relating to their experiences.\n

24170	3484	0	3	Kids can learn vocabulary related to human anatomy, as well as the orientation of structures within eight systems of the human body: digestive, respiratory, skeletal, urinary, sensory, muscular, and cardiovascular. Through the options to virtually zoom, rotate, and "dissect" the 3-D models by tapping a button that deletes layers and allows kids to look deeper into the model of the body, kids can also learn to visually place everything that makes up the systems in human body as they relate to each other (muscle, bone, organ, etc).  Kids can also learn fun facts about the inner-workings of their body, raising body awareness. My Incredible Body shows the inside of the human body in medically accurate, memorable ways.\n

Specific learning categories include math, Spanish, social skills, and more. Some also are categorized by age (3–5 or 6–8), which may help emerging readers identify books that best fit their reading levels. By listening to the narrator read and watching the highlighted words track the narrator's voice, kids may improve reading skills and reading speed, as well as increase their subject-specific vocabulary.

They'll be motivated to brush to see the characters come to life on the device, and getting them to focus on a full two minutes is easier as they watch the picture revealed. Due to the unpredictability of the scanning (and even then, only being able to scan a purchased product), kids aren't very empowered, and the character diversity is lacking (as of this review, only the white princesses are included).

They'll develop socially and emotionally as they observe the monster's reactions when it's fed or when the food doesn't make it to its mouth, for whatever reason.

They'll also learn about routines, which parents can use to help reinforce their own routines for bath time, mealtime, bedtime, getting dressed, and even visiting the doctor. Dancing and singing along with the song can help develop vocabulary and gross motor skills, and coloring the pages can help develop creativity and fine motor skills. The simple interactions and gestures make this a good choice for beginning app users, and it's a great conversation starter for parents and kids.\n

24261	3497	0	4	The game gently walks you through the early levels, with a focus on single-player. By the time players venture into the multiplayer arena, they have a good understanding of what's necessary. \n
24262	3497	1	2	The game is classified as an action/strategy title for a good reason. Although you spend some time building up your village, the game is more about attacking NPC (non-player character) goblins or the villages of other players to loot gold and elixir. There's no blood, but, when your troops are killed, they scream and briefly become ghosts, and then tombstones are shown on the ground. \n

24264	3497	3	2	A live chat presents the opportunity for iffy language, though the game has a well-defined system to report users. \n
24265	3497	4	2	Kids can learn to strategize and learn from their mistakes. Defeating enemies is not simply a matter of having the most troops. They must be deployed smartly, or you will lose. Similarly, watching footage of enemies storming your village can instruct players on how to deploy resources to win battles. It's similar to a football player watching game film to better his performance. Clash of Clans doesn't offer a deep learning experience, but players will be able to practice strategy and reflect on their decisions.\n

Endless Alphabet has a simple premise that offers engaging content in an exploration-friendly format.\n

The process of taking a photo, then sizing it to fit the app's tool to make the hair and facial expressions look as realistic as possible, also provides a lesson in using and applying technology to create new digital images. This creative app empowers kids to envision wild styles on themselves and others with no long-term bad hair days.\n

They'll also explore and experiment with textures and different artistic tools in the extensive artist's palette. They'll learn about different tools in a doctor's office, such as the scale, blood-pressure cuff, exam table, and eye chart, as well as develop compassion as they treat Doc's toy patients, Lambie and Marvin. Preschool art has no rules, and kids can explore and create without making a mess with Doc McStuffins Color and Play.\n

They'll learn the foods included in different meals -- such as seaweed, rice, veggies, and fish in sushi -- as well as the names and appearances of individual foods, such as mushrooms, tomatoes, and avocados. They'll even learn some basic manners, including how to use different utensils, cleaning up when they're finished, and saying, "Excuse me," after accidentally burping while eating. Yo Gabba Gabba! Party in My Tummy is a fun song to encourage kids to eat well, and the app is a great way to reinforce good eating habits.\n

Even though there is no text involved, kids can build literacy skills through imaginative play. If kids create a story around Fins, they'll practice narrative skills. Since this may be one of the first apps little ones explore, they'll become familiar with the touchscreen as well as scrolling and tapping gestures. They'll also learn cause and effect as they see that tapping the yellow dot causes an animated interaction. The beauty of Sago Mini Ocean Swimmer is that it's fun, open play for kids -- and that's just how little ones learn.\n
24304	3503	1	1	The little fishy's adventures lead him into some silly encounters. He's swallowed by a whale and sucked into a sea plant, but he's never harmed, and it's not scary at all. \n

24306	3503	3	1	The fishy encounters some mild potty humor, which is sure to delight potty-training or recently potty-trained little ones. A bird poops on his boat, a seahorse poops in the water, and larger fish burp out smaller fish.\n

In several mini-games, kids are working toward a number goal -- hatching 100 chicks or getting 20 chicks through the maze -- so they'll be aware of the goal and count along as they work toward it. The puzzle game also develops spatial reasoning, and the maze game helps with problem solving. Kids will see that baby chicks hatch from eggs, too. Peppa Pig - Happy Mrs Chicken is hampered by imprecise controls and repetition, so kids may not stick with it for long.\n

Nemo's dad Marlin teaches him a variety of factoids about ocean life -- for example, how certain plants attract certain types of fish, which in turn create a healthy ecosystem. Kids will see how all the plants and animals work together in the reef, although there's not a lot of hard science here. Kids will need to save up pearls for special plants, so they can learn a bit about budgeting and working toward a goal. Nemo's Reef is a pleasant, if a bit shallow, journey into the vibrant underwater world.\n

Although there are serious limits to the sorts of notes that can be created within the app, features for organizing notes and reviewing them in a systematic way are powerful. Sophisticated users might take notes or upload and format notes from a laptop or desktop computer and then use this app as their on-the-go option for study and review. OneNote, while a shadow of its robust desktop version, can help kids track and access their notes on the go. \n

In free play mode, kids have the opportunity to experiment with the tools and let their creativity run wild, while the challenge mode encourages them to problem-solve and think critically to help accomplish a series of increasingly challenging tasks. As they do, kids will learn a little about biology, a bit about engineering and physics, and about some of the underlying principles in science and math.\n

As they play others, they'll learn how their own spelling skills rank against those of their peers and get information to help track correct and incorrect answers. Miss Spell's Class would benefit from a clear leveling system, but the more kids play and see improvement, the more confident they'll become.\n

Although retention isn't part of the game, frequent players will find that questions repeat, so they'll see whether they learned the fact the first time around. During the round, if a player selects a wrong answer, it turns red. Correct answers turn green when selected or when the timer runs out, and completed quizzes can be reviewed. Over 400 trivia categories include academic areas such as geography, history, literature, science, and music, while an educational category encompasses spelling, vocabulary, grammar, and math. There's also a lot of pop culture and common knowledge tested, from Harry Potter to sports heroes. Kids can have low-pressure fun with QuizUp and maybe hold on to a few facts as they play.\n

24352	3510	0	3	Kids can learn the importance of brushing teeth twice a day for two minutes. They'll learn proper techniques for moving the brush up and down and side to side and getting all parts of their teeth, front and back and tops. They'll learn to brush away from their gums and to give their tongue a brush, too. The timer helps kids know how long to brush. It's all positive -- there's no yuck mouth or cavity if kids don't succeed. They're simply encouraged to brush and to do it correctly. Toothsavers Brushing Game makes brushing teeth fun for kids, and parents can feel good knowing kids are brushing thoroughly if they're following along.\n

Matching numbers is important, but users also have to keep an eye on what's coming up and where that number might go.

This makes it easier for them to keep track of schoolwork and other important files so they can stress less and focus on more important things. Box can be a handy tool for kids who want to keep track of school documents and lots more.\n

In the videos, Annie and Moby present new concepts (how to classify animals) and define new vocabulary words. Kids can test their comprehension and retention after watching a video with short multiple-choice quizzes. They also can form connections among topics by exploring other videos related to something they've already watched; they may even discover a new interest! BrainPOP Jr. Movie of the Week offers great videos, though kids' learning could be enhanced with interactive elements to encourage deeper, more active learning.\n

24464	3526	0	4	For kids who are experienced gamers, Math Evolve is fun and intuitive to play. Kids who haven't played arcade-style games may find multitasking to solve math problems and blast aliens overwhelming at first. Practice mode lets kids with less gaming experience or who prefer less pressure practice math skills without the shooting/defensive piece. Kids can set the difficulty level for both math skills and gameplay.\n
24465	3526	1	4	Kids can learn and practice multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and mental math skills with Math Evolve. The arcade-style gameplay will appeal to especially young gamers, but kids who aren't as familiar with arcade games can also enjoy the app in the less-busy practice mode. The range of settings and two modes of play make it easy to customize the experience. Math Evolve is a great way to get kids hooked on practicing math facts.\n

24471	3527	0	4	Math Vs Zombies is intuitive to play. Kids select a level (easy, medium, or hard) and play through seven levels of each basic mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), which progress incrementally. Kids touch numbers on the screen to answer questions, zap zombies with a lightning-bolt button on the right of the screen, or correct mistakes with a left "clear" button. Kids can exit the game at any time and return to the point where they left off. Levels can be reset at any time.\n
24472	3527	1	3	Kids can learn math facts and practice math computation skills in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from the basics to multiple-digit operations. First graders can turn zombies into humans by solving addition problems with almost guaranteed success; the first game has +0 and +1 facts only and each level advances to include those facts and builds in two or three more fact families. Older kids (and adults!) will find the hard levels to be challenging as it requires mental math to solve the problems quickly. From first graders learning simple math facts to older elementary students doing more complex math, Math Vs Zombies is part skill application and part arcade game that will keep kids coming back.\n \n

24479	3528	1	3	Kids can learn to identify and control emotions that may lead to inappropriate behavior. Zones of Regulation supports and reinforces the skills taught through a curriculum of the same name, geared toward helping kids gain skills in consciously identifying emotions and regulating their actions. It supports social-emotional development by creating scenarios with an avatar kids choose. Kids view life situations and must choose the best option for reacting to the situation. Zones of Regulation can help kids learn to identify and understand their emotions, but you'll need to purchase the related curriculum to get the most out of the app.\n

The challenges really boost kids' problem-solving and creative-thinking skills, and the unconventional materials may help kids think differently when solving problems in real life. Although the lack of hints and directions may seem frustrating at first, it really encourages kids to take ownership of the challenge and try out multiple scenarios to see if they can complete the task. When they do, they're rewarded with a "good job" and the satisfaction of knowing they figured it out on their own. Pettson's Inventions gives kids a great opportunity to use their creative problem-solving skills while learning a little science.\n

They will work with shapes and angles, force and motion, electricity and energy flow, and other important concepts while they build their problem-solving and logic skills through tasks such as building an airplane, connecting a series of pipes so water can flow, or turning on light bulbs to scare ghosts out of the room. Pettson's Inventions 2 is a little less silly than its predecessor, but its fun, creative learning vibe remains the same.\n

Since you can select the match concepts and number of questions kids are exposed to in one sitting, the app is customizable to each kid who plays. Splash Math is flexible enough to be used by most children with and without disabilities, except for those with vision or fine motor disabilities.\n
24507	3532	1	3	Kids can learn first-grade-level math skills in an entertaining way. They'll use models, number lines, and virtual coins and clocks to answer multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions.

The narrator gives lessons as clues: "A right triangle is a triangle with a corner that looks like a square"; "Find all the blue pentagons...a pentagon has five sides"; or "Think about how the food will bounce off the walls." Before kids begin the augmented-reality game "Patch the Path," the app walks them through a test round to help them get comfortable with the concept of looking at and interacting with the printed board through the iPad camera. Still, it can be clunky and awkward to play focused on the paper gameboard, at least until kids get the hang of it.\n

It's helpful if (but not essential that) kids know the names of basic shapes before using this app. The narrator skillfully weaves critical-thinking and shapes lessons into the basic instructions kids need to navigate the games. Before kids begin the augmented-reality game "Patch the Path," they try a test round to understand how to interact with the printed board through the iPad camera, as they learn to use and apply technology in this way. CyberChase Shape Quest! helps kids who already know a little about shapes apply that information in fun ways.\n

24521	3534	1	5	You'll find everything you can imagine here: gang warfare, beatings, drive-by shootings, the killing of innocent bystanders, and bloody deaths. Players can drive on the sidewalk, running over pedestrians at will, or assault a pedestrian on the street, beating him to death to get money (or beating a police officer to death to get his weapon).\n
24522	3534	2	3	Explicitly sexual. Prostitutes are prominent characters in the game, both as part of the story and non-player characters -- and they're dressed in low-cut apparel, true to the streetwalker cliche. You can gain "health points" by having implied sex with a prostitute in your car, where you hear what's happening and watch the rhythmic actions of the couple from a distance but don't actually see the act. \n
24523	3534	3	5	There's near-constant profanity, with innumerable f-bombs and pretty much any other word you can think of. And if you happen to miss the audio version, the words are often in the captions. \n

Kids will learn that, even though there's often more than one way to solve a problem (or write a program), cleaner and more efficient solutions are preferred; here, those are rewarded with stars. With the growing availability of kid-targeted programming apps, Lightbot best suits kids already drawn to programming and logic who also thrive on puzzles and challenges.\n

They'll develop resilience as they overcome frustrations and challenges on their own. Breathe, Think, Do with Sesame is a valuable tool for teaching kids how to handle frustrating situations (and a great reminder for adults, too).\n

Phrasalstein is geared especially for English-language learners, so the option is available to get instructions and definitions in other languages (Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, German, and Russian).\n
24542	3537	1	2	Some mild cartoon violence goes with the monster theme. For the phrasal "break through," a body pops out of a man's stomach, showing some blood. For "go off," a bomb explodes.\n \n
24543	3537	2	1	One of the phrasals included is "vamp up," described as a woman wearing clothes that make her more sexually attractive to men. The animation shows the Bride of Frankenstein changing into a sexy dress for Dr. Frankenstein.\n

24545	3537	4	3	Kids can learn some of the phrasal verbs used in the English language. These phrases are especially confusing for English-language learners, and the short animations, definitions, and sample sentences will help kids understand words that don't always translate literally. Phrasalstein includes terms such as "lock up," "mist over," "tidy up," and "wash down."

24611	3547	0	2	This app is not as easy to use as some other flashcard-based apps. The app's user interface isn't as intuitive as the website itself. The website-app connection is almost essential, which teens may not understand at first when downloading or paying for the app. Users likely will need to dig into the tutorials on the website to get a good grasp of the app. Once they understand how to use it, there are numerous settings to customize flashcards.\n
24612	3547	1	1	All flashcards are user-submitted and no oversight is suggested. Some of the online flashcard sets may reference violence or contain violent images.\n
24613	3547	2	3	All flashcards are user-submitted and no oversight is suggested. A few of the online flashcard sets reference sex, either in academic or simply lurid contexts.\n
24614	3547	3	3	All flashcards are user-submitted and no oversight is suggested. Lots of swear words such as "s--t," "bitch," "f--k" used in titles of the flashcards.\n
24615	3547	4	2	Kids can learn to memorize facts about many subjects via the flashcards created and shared on StudyDroid: Flashcards 2.0. Teens can search the website for flashcard packs on an almost endless supply of topics -- from anatomy to Spanish vocabulary, from astronomy to zoology -- created by others. They also can learn to create digital flashcards themselves on the app or the website, with images if desired, and sync them to their mobile devices. Once teens figure out the tricky user interface, StudyDroid is an OK tool for entering and studying flashcards -- but there are better options available.\n

24632	3550	0	5	A simple design allows the writing process to start quickly. Short step-by-step tutorial helps those who need a little extra help.\n
24633	3550	1	2	Scenarios may include or lead to instances of mild violence and fantasy violence, including content that features vampires and other fantasy creatures and the suggestion of stories centered on killing another character.\n
24634	3550	2	1	A few scenarios encourage writing about actions such as kissing or romantic relationships, which may not be appropriate for younger kids.\n
24635	3550	3	1	Minor instances of adult language, such as, "Start writing a story that begins with the dialogue, 'Oh, hell! What have you done?'"\n
24636	3550	4	3	Kids can learn how to write creatively and how to be disciplined in their writing habits. As they receive new scenarios and story descriptions, kids may find that their stories become more than could ever have imagined, boosting confidence in their writing skills and motivating them to write even more. Becoming a strong writer takes practice. Kids will learn to build their writing skills by getting in plenty of writing practice as they explore the creative scenarios and other suggestions offered by Writing Challenge. With the help of time limits, Writing Challenge lets kids write in manageable blocks, keeping writing enjoyable instead of it becoming overwhelming.\n

You're expected to keep pace with it, which isn't easy (although when that fails, trial and error can work). Lazors encourages players to use logic and creativity to find solutions.\n

Vocabulary themes include first words, food and drink, sports, clothes, the digital world, relationships, media, work, and lifestyle. However, the app skips over grammar and verb conjugations. Although the iOS version includes short, end-of-lesson evaluations, overall the app doesn't really motivate kids to keep going. Learn Spanish with babbel.com needs a lot more pep and in-depth learning to give kids the immersion necessary to learn a second language.\n

Not only can they learn to identify the basic parts of speech, but they'll also learn about more specific parts and the relationships among parts (examples include transitive and intransitive verbs as well as subordinating and correlative conjunctions). There are also brief explanations of dependent clauses, punctuating interjections, and other writing structures. Grammaropolis is a thorough, engaging tool for young grammar learners.\n

Defeated enemies disappear in puffs of smoke. Pigs that are damaged but not yet defeated display bruising and sometimes bleeding.

Players need to analyze each tower and evaluate their birds' (or pigs') abilities before setting out to demolish structures in as efficient a manner as possible. Kids also can use momentum to make objects slam into each other and cause destructive chain reactions. Angry Birds Star Wars II lets kids observe real-world physics concepts through hands-on, trial-and-error puzzle solving.\n

24682	3557	1	1	Players tap on a garbage can that makes a round, black bomb with a fuse appear when they want to clear the screen of buildings. Kids tap on the bomb, and then all the objects they've included in their car world vanish in a cloud of smoke.\n

24685	3557	4	2	Even though Toca Cars doesn't include directions or lessons on any specific subject or learning skills, kids can learn about motion and momentum as they watch how moving their finger in different directions on the screen affects where their car travels, how objects are knocked down by being bumped, and how their car floats in the air after driving up a ramp. They can exercise their creativity as they arrange objects in their own driving world. The digital creative play in Toca Cars may inspire kids to build their own real-life cardboard world, but the learning in the app itself isn't particularly deep.\n

You can deselect content providers in the settings to keep objectionable material at bay.\n
24692	3558	4	3	Kids can learn about the cultures, histories, and geographies of the places where they live or the places they may be visiting. Field Trip also can help kids learn to efficiently and effectively use technology, and parents can use the Offers & Deals section to start conversations about targeted marketing and making wise buying decisions. The impressive resources augment real and virtual field trips, supplementing what kids see with stories and data.\n

They can use deductive reasoning in dishing out food to the right restaurant customers. In other games they can practice mapping skills. However, games like the one using "positioning" vocabulary have questionable math value and seem a bit young for the target age range. With Fizzy's Lunch Lab Fresh Pick, kids can get practice with some math-related tasks, but its real learning value is a bit ambiguous.\n

They can see, using visual manipulatives, how addition, subtraction, and multiplication work. They can build fluency practicing math facts. The activities across three grade levels are aligned with Common Core State Standards and include telling time, skip counting, and word problems as well as arithmetic. Verbal and visual support, as well as fine motor options for dragging and dropping or writing in answers, meet the needs for different learning abilities. With Todo Math, kids get solid math practice with no distractions or barriers to learning.\n

24755	3567	4	4	Kids can learn about spatial reasoning by trying to fit geometric shapes into a geography-themed shape set on a grid. Doodle Fit 2: Around the World blocks mirror the classic four-unit Tetris shapes with a few extras thrown in: a single cube, two- and three-unit rods, and three-unit corners. Kids will study the shapes given and assess how blocks fit together through mental and virtual trial and error, learning along the way that some shapes are more flexible than others. The "Around the World" theme sets the game on a rotating globe, and kids may absorb some geography tidbits as they play. Timed mode forces kids to think about time management as they complete challenging puzzles against the clock, and sandbox mode lets them experiment and use their imaginations. Overall, Doodle Fit 2: Around the World does the original proud and boosts learning potential along the way.\n

24783	3571	4	3	Kids can learn to create digital drawings and coloring pages; practice fine-motor-writing skills by tracing swirls, waves, and zigzags; and assemble simple line drawings from simple shapes. Overall, the app could use a bit more depth and balance, and navigation could be tightened up by eliminating layers in the Android versions, especially the ones that show options in too-small thumbnail sizes. PicsArt for Kids gives kids lots of creative options but in some cases doesn't follow through completely, as far as functionality goes.\n

24787	3572	1	2	Users spend much of the game killing the undead using various plant-based life forms that shoot weapons or cause explosions. This time around, players can be a part of the process, too, with power-ups that let you squeeze the zombies' heads off or zap them with electricity.

24790	3572	4	2	Kids can learn strategic thinking, asset allocation, and how to plan ahead in Plants vs. Zombies 2. Players must protect themselves by growing plants. Different plants do different sorts of damage to different types of zombie attackers, so players must deduce which qualities each plant has. Clicking on sunlight that drops in the yard gives kids points so they can buy new plants. Budgeting also is a skill kids can practice here, since they have a limited amount of resources to build defensive units. Like its predecessor, Plants vs. Zombies 2 is a goofy exercise in strategy and planning.\n

Preschoolers can develop important pre-reading and early-language skills as they follow verbal directions, sort things where they belong, and play with made-up words for the diagnosis. Kids can choose an object to examine or take photos of their own stuffed animals. Some of the activities require kids to make decisions.

The display treasure chest gives kids a place to drop their coins and bills as they count. Through the use of money, kids get an opportunity to apply what they know about counting. Two games are pretty similar, and coins sometimes get stuck next to the treasure chest; still, that doesn't hold up the show. A game or two more would really round out this app and make it shine. Learn to Count Money may sound like a plank walk, but the cute pirate theme makes counting money fun.\n

24825	3577	4	3	Kids can learn counting with numbers 1 to 10 and learn some vocabulary for food items. They'll also practice good listening skills and following directions to complete the tasks. Kids will get lots of repetition and exposure to counting in this educational app as they count foods that the caterpillar wants to eat, and for counting skills practice makes perfect! Still -- even with several games -- the app isn't likely to hold most kids' attention for long. Though kids can learn and practice counting with Counting with the Very Hungry Butterfly, it's not strong in engagement or depth.\n

The interactive elements all clearly appear as such on the screen, and verbal directions often accompany them. Results of app sessions are automatically emailed to parents' email addresses.\n
24829	3578	1	1	No overt violence, but there's far more yelling and screaming and good-guys-vs.-bad-guys stuff than on your typical math app. \n

24832	3578	4	3	Kids can learn lots of fractions concepts, starting as simple as "What is a half?" to progressively more difficult concepts such as equivalent fractions and more. As kids follow the story line and the directions they're given, they interact with the app to solve problems that move the story along. Bonus: It's great to see a female main character helping set the example for kids that math is an equal-opportunity subject. Overall, The Digits: Fraction Blast is a great way to introduce kids to fraction concepts via a silly space adventure story with endearing characters.\n

24835	3579	0	3	For the game to last more than an hour or so will require some serious strategic thinking. This necessity isn't something players will immediately recognize, though, and the game's minimal instructions don't emphasize this aspect. As a result, the game will require some trial and error before you start to build skills.\n
24836	3579	1	2	Enemies attack your base fairly regularly, but they're shown as comet-like devices, and weapons-fire makes the "pew pew" sound that takes away any realism. Also, since the game is so minimalist, the violence is merely implied rather than being realistic.\n

24838	3579	3	0	
24839	3579	4	3	Kids can learn and practice with strategic thinking and object placement. By scattering resources throughout the base, players waste valuable time and put themselves at risk. This isn't obvious at the game's outset, so some trial and error is involved to master the levels; players may have to start over once or twice. Once they get it, rymdkapsel will show kids that assessing a situation before acting is beneficial in achieving success.\n

Tweens and teens will learn through experience and develop their unique artist's style as they experiment with the different colors and brushes. The movie feature allows them to replay the strokes they used to create a piece, which can help artists refine their technique. Sketch Guru - Handy Sketch Pad can be a good way for young artists to express their creativity -- if they can ignore the distracting ads. \n

They can learn sight words and phonics. The activities jump around to different letters and rhymes rather than focusing on one at a time, and, though parents can control which activities are included, they cannot choose specific letters or words. Monkey Word School Adventure's six fun activities help kids build an early-reading foundation.\n

24856	3582	0	3	The game offers only rudimentary instructions on taking care of the virtual pet, but it's pretty self-explanatory. Games are offshoots of other popular titles, so will likely be familiar to kids. \n

24860	3582	4	2	Kids can learn a little about responsibility and the importance of taking care of another creature. If left alone, Pou will die from starvation or exhaustion. Kids need to check in with him frequently -- and play with him -- to ensure he's safe and happy. While the experience isn't deep, Pou's virtual-pet gameplay shows kids that taking care of a creature requires responsibility and that there are consequences for not following through.\n

Data like distance, scale, travel time, cardinal directions, and even traffic conditions will empower kids to make informed decisions about getting around -- from making it to a new friend's party to safely biking across town. One downside is the apparent inability to use specialized maps for instance hiking trails. Google Maps is an essential navigation tool that empowers kids to explore their world.\n

24891	3587	0	4	Like its predecessors, this game features a smart learning curve making it easy to pick up. Puzzles become more difficult in later levels, but success remains largely a matter of trial and error -- and players aren't penalized for how many times they try to solve the puzzle. And they're rewarded after each level with a small cartoon-like animation. \n
24892	3587	1	1	This game's Mickey isn't the kindly uncle many kids are used to -- and occasionally has fits of anger (slamming a bucket against a pump, for example). A lemon jumping into a barrel misses and has to be taken away in an ambulance, but it's all cartoonish violence. \n

The app focuses chiefly on problem solving in the early levels, asking players to divert water to the proper receptacle to move to the next level. But as the game advances, players will have to use lava and wind to solve the puzzle. Kids will laugh a lot and can exercise their problem-solving skills in the process.\n

24902	3588	4	3	Kids can learn to read quickly with retention using Reading Trainer, which can be a useful skill. Still, teens generally need to focus less on speed and more on comprehension, literary analysis, and vocabulary development -- which require close, careful reading rather than speed. The exercises -- like timed word searches and word scrambles -- train teens' brains to look for relevant information quickly. Even without focusing on speed reading, the brain exercises in Reading Trainer can help teens think and react clearly and quickly.\n

24909	3589	4	3	Kids can learn how to set and maintain healthy information-sharing boundaries in the world of social networking by sharing more personal information with limited people on Path and less personal information with more people via other social networks they link to their Path account. Teens can also practice conveying messages effectively with multiple forms of expression, and friendship building. Used appropriately, Path can help teens learn the art of appropriate, selective information sharing with various circles of family, friends, school or professional contacts, and acquaintances.\n

24912	3590	0	3	Very easy to play, but with a bit of help and a learning curve for the monster-making component. Kids will need some help setting up their user profile and choosing appropriate settings to customize the activities to their current math level, but after that it's easy to navigate options. The main screen includes the three main subject choices, along with the Play Box (which lists them again individually), monster lab (where they can buy monster parts with earned points to build monsters), and addition and subtraction tables. The monster-making game takes a bit of time and trial-and-error to learn how to navigate, but once kids get it, it's easy.\n

Teens can use the "clean" theme and select no audio to practice writing a short screenplay, developing choreography, recruiting actors, planning or creating sets, and shooting some footage. For productions more than 2.5 minutes long or control over cuts and transitions, however, teens will need a different tool. Magisto makes video creation fun and quick but automated editing limits learning potential for aspiring filmmakers.\n

They'll learn the gist of programming concepts like procedural abstraction, subroutines, looping constructs, and conditional programming without having to master the lingo or detailed syntax of code. Kids will practice tackling a big problem by breaking it down into smaller problems to solve, a foundation of writing good code. Cargo-Bot is a simple concept that packs a challenging punch and teaches valuable programming skills.\n

24958	3596	4	4	Teens can learn a huge range of skills related to digital drawing, photography, and presentation. Though tutorials and reference material are absent, teens will forge ahead capturing the world in their sights, imagining new compositions, and combining color, form, and framing while increasing self-awareness and developing confidence in themselves through contests and membership in an arts community.

24965	3597	4	4	Kids can learn to follow instructions and improve reading comprehension, not to mention pick up a few cool project ideas (primarily electricity and electronics), recipes, and ways to make toys and create fashion. If kids decide to contribute an Instructable, they will learn to express specific ideas to others concretely by crafting step-by-step text instructions and snapping illustrative photos. Instructables gives tweens and teens the opportunity to learn from others plus showcase their creativity and instruction-writing skills, but supervision is required.\n

25238	3636	4	3	Tweens and teens can learn parts of speech and concise definitions -- often one-word synonyms -- for a selection of 300 middle-school words. Learning may be distilled down to the basics, but the missing usage examples might make learning shallow. Middle School Vocabulary Prep offers kids solid practice but misses opportunities to engage and empower them.\n

25241	3637	0	5	Sesame Street caters to the preschool crowd, and the app's controls are easy for a preschooler to navigate. Games flow right into the next, but kids do have to click to choose to change activities.\n
25245	3637	4	5	Kids can learn how to recognize and trace numerals and count from 1 to 20. Kids also begin some early addition and subtraction. Elmo provides interactive cues and guidance to help preschoolers learn to listen. At almost every step, the app empowers kids to choose which number or activity to explore. A parents' section tracks progress and time played. Elmo Loves 123s offers preschoolers an excellent tool for learning numbers and counting 1 to 20.\n

25259	3639	4	3	Kids can learn to increase their efficiency in basic operations, pre-algebra, algebra, four-quadrant graphing, and probability. The "game over" page allows kids to analyze performance with an efficiency (speed) score as well as a percentile based on other users. A user forum (really just a global scoring report) presents a level of data most kids won't want, but it's nice for parents. Questions are not always absolutely clear and "help" is not fully developed. Overall, Math Pack Flash Cards offers good learning potential despite a few rough edges.\n

25263	3640	1	2	Chased by flying monkeys and other enemies, the effects of being caught in this version of the game are slightly different from the effects in other Temple Run games. If he catches up to you, the flying monkey will whisk you away to what appears to be a dire fate, but that's not shown onscreen. Similarly, players can die by running off a ledge, running into a tree, or failing to slide or jump in time. The app has no blood or sounds of suffering, other than a slight scream when you fall off a cliff.\n

They'll complete timed quizzes and have a 5-second penalty added to their time for incorrect answers. The app combines the best of flash cards and timed pencil-and-paper quizzes and progress charts into one convenient app. The user interface is clean and straightforward.

25280	3642	4	2	Kids can learn to practice adding single- and double-digit numbers mentally. The easy level, appropriate for kindergarten to first grade, presents only single digits and a few possible sums at bottom. The more difficult levels, appropriate for second- or even third-graders, float up to six sometimes-overlapping addends across the screen and five or six possible sums to choose from at bottom. Scoring might appeal to kids but it's pretty meaningless. Math Runner Plus is a visually engaging game but is lacking in pace and variety.\n

They will need a parent or teacher to introduce and reinforce these subjects, but this app can serve as a handy reference for certain formulas and processes, in particular geometric shapes -- both plane and solid -- some conversions, and some finance. Mathinary provides some useful reference but still needs significant development before it can be considered comprehensive.\n

25294	3644	4	3	Kids can learn multiplication facts from zeroes to twelves. In a rapid-fire environment, kids will have to focus and master controls to be successful. Because data isn't broken down by specific math facts, targeted assessment isn't possible. Also, the fast pace and sometimes unclear visuals (text that doesn't stand out against its background color) might overshadow the actual math. Times Tables Warp: The Multiplication Facts Game is an exciting times-table ride, but the learning can get left behind.\n

25312	3647	1	3	There's a surprising amount of violence, given the cute, woodland stars of the game. Players can zap others with bolts of lightning (rendering opponents to nothing more than a skull), attack them with buzz saw blades that slice them in half (and coat the screen with blood), and behead them with a bear trap (splashing the screen with more blood). \n

Kids in early elementary-school grades can use the pens to draw visual cues as they solve problems and rely on their already memorized math facts. Older kids can use the pens to solve the problems step-by-step on the screen. Some problems within each level seem much more complicated than others. Multiple choice answers are provided.

25340	3651	1	3	Can contain violent or simulated violent behavior. It was easy to find posts promoting guns, knives, and other weapons -- sometimes accompanied by children's music. There were also videos of fist fighting, both real and simulated.\n
25341	3651	2	3	Some explicit sexual content, but it's much less likely to show up during casual use. While some hashtags have been disabled, making it more challenging to find hardcore sexual content if you're looking for it, many posters work hard to get around the filters. Some posts appear with a warning ("This post may contain sensitive content. Tap to view."). Others contain no warning and will just start playing.\n

They can also learn to control their own study experience and adjust controls depending on their own needs. Through advanced, though perhaps overly detailed, statistics kids can also examine performance to determine areas needing improvement. Kids will not learn any advanced middle school algebra or pre-algebra skills. Math Attack Pro is a solid but somewhat dry quiz app that offers kids decent practice with some flexibility.\n

Candies are scattered in different ways each level, keeping the game fresh, but strategy is critical in choosing the most beneficial moves. There's also the possibility of choosing a power-up to take into each level -- should players choose to purchase and utilize them. Be warned, they can be expensive, but choosing the right one makes many levels easier. Candy Crush Saga is partially about luck, but players can also use a bit of strategy as they solve the puzzles.\n

25364	3654	4	4	Kids can learn about our amazing world through first-person data -- actual satellite views of the Earth. Kids can see melting ice sheets in Antarctica, devastation from Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey, and mining operations in Colombia, as well as photovoltaic arrays in San Francisco and thriving wildlife refuge areas in Hawaii. Unfortunately, the search database is abridged and it lacks the PC version tools and special views as well. Google Earth app is an unparalleled tool for exploring the Earth, though much less powerful than the PC version.\n

25378	3656	4	2	Kids can learn advanced vocabulary, especially handy for SAT or ACT prep. They can review definitions alphabetically or by random or focus only on words they've marked as favorites or have missed on prior quizzes. Practicing recognizing the words by definition in the quizzes or by antonym or synonym gives kids more practice in how the words may be presented on tests too. Though there are other, more engaging options, uVocab - Vocabulary Trainer can give kids some solid vocabulary prep.\n

They'll read short descriptions peppered with interesting facts (such as that one of Saturn's moons, Mimas, has an enormous crater that makes it look like the "Death Star" from Star Wars, even though detailed images of the moon showing the crater weren't available when the movies were made.

For example, very young kids can learn that deserts are hot and dry so dolphins can't live there, building the concept that there are logical reasons why species live where they do. Kids can also learn some basic nature vocabulary, such as the names of animals and ecosystems. Kids are instructed to find animals in groups of a certain number, providing counting practice along with animal recognition.

25410	3661	1	4	Players can kill other humans, including police officers, or drive into pedestrians on sidewalks and parks. There are beatings, gang warfare, drive-by shootings, and bloody deaths, many shown in up-close detail. For example, players can drive on the sidewalk, running over pedestrians at will or assault a pedestrian on the street, beating him to death to get money (or beating a police officer to death to get his weapon).\n
25411	3661	2	4	Explicitly sexual. Prostitutes are prominent characters in the game, both as part of the story and non-player characters -- and they're dressed in low-cut apparel, true to the streetwalker cliche. You can gain "health points" by having implied sex with a prostitute in your car, where you hear what is happening and watch rhythmic actions of the couple from a distance, but don't actually see the act.\n

25434	3664	4	4	Although Time Timer was created as a productivity tool, kids can learn time management, working efficiently, and even perhaps gain in-the-moment motivation by using this app. Throughout education and life, kids and adults are expected to perform under time pressure on tests and other tasks. In some instances and for some kids, time pressure may even help boost productivity and creativity. This app may help kids learn to manage time-related stress and practice focusing to stay on task. Time Timer can help kids appreciate the value of time and use it well.\n

Users can share posts with friends via a number of social networking options. To post on the app, users give access to their photo library and use the iFunny Studio to post a new "poster," "rage comic," or "meme."\n
25453	3667	2	4	Posts contain lots of sexual innuendo (including sexually explicit cartoon images), inappropriate photos that focus on women's body parts in sexual ways, sex toys shown in jokes, and prevalent sexual banter.\n

25460	3668	2	4	The app is full of sexual content, crude humor, and suggestive themes that pop up as captions on the photos users take via the mobile device or access on Facebook. Captions are randomly generated unless users purchase the upgrade for more options. Many captions include sexually derogatory statements about women. Caption examples with sexual content: "I want to be inside of you," another "You know what they say about sluts."\n
25461	3668	3	4	Captions include nearly every swear word and profane phrase: "I'm a muthaf-- monster," "You're an a--hole."\n

The bridges in this version of the game make it easier than the original Flow Free app. If your kids find some levels too easy, they can play in time trial mode, switch to a larger board or go to a different level pack altogether. Settings include sound levels, flow "labels" (letters) off or on (to make the game accessible for color blind people), and resetting game levels. \n

Kids can learn the importance of thinking before making a decision as they look at the number of moves it takes them to solve each puzzle. Flow Free: Bridges requires enough critical thinking for a mental workout and provides bridges and hints to help reduce kids' frustration.\n

Crazy Formula gives kids a starting and end point (sometimes more than one) and a limited number of pieces to connect them. They must then figure out how to connect points so that the fluid flows between the points without leaking. While Crazy Formula has no hints for players if they get stuck, kids who persevere get a confidence boost and may challenge themselves to solve more involved puzzles.\n

The CGI animations also help kids handle stress by developing self-reliance to move beyond emotional obstacles. The in-app visual and aural cues are accessible to kids with developmental and learning differences. While the aural and video cues can't be modified, still picture and text cues can be customized to match specific emotions and coping strategies. The customization options and impressive animations help make My DPS a great way to learn about emotions.\n

Letters are paired with an object beginning with that letter. There's not much feedback other than whether an answer is correct.

The free version of Animoto Video Maker is limiting, but with a paid upgrade, the app is a solid media-creation tool that can support teens' learning goals.\n

For example, a patient starts in the waiting room, moves to a patient room, has a medical test or procedure, and then they are better. Kids also learn about the body, emotional awareness, and empathy for patients. Kids can learn that doctors, hospitals, and procedures don't have to be scary. Dr. Panda's Hospital is a cute way for little kids to learn about health care but could offer more feedback.\n

For example, Sing Along City includes books set to familiar songs, and Classics Grove features classic stories. Titles feature racial, ethnic, and religious diversity, and if a kid chooses to hear the book read, the words are highlighted as they follow along, which supports early reading skills. Farfaria Storybooks - Library of Children's Books and Read Along With Me Stories  can be a solid literacy tool, so long as kids are eager to read and have adults nearby to offer feedback.\n

For example, the problem "Collect numbers that multiply to make 15" sets the player's marble off into the maze seeking to roll over the numbers 5 and 3 and avoiding the numbers 6, 7, and 4. Kids can also practice their money and time skills. Decision-making and strategy skills are inherent parts of this game as kids move their marble through the maze. Marble Math Junior is an exceptionally fun way to practice math.\n

With the audio options, kids can choose to hear the whole sentence or individual words, allowing them to build reading skills at their own pace. Furthermore, sentence completion and word matching activities help kids attend to print concepts such as sentence structure and word length.

Mickey provides great feedback to help kids out and to reinforce the concepts. Finally, a nice feature at the end is that Mickey goes back and reviews everything, which can help comprehension skills. Although the content may be limited as it's just one appisode, this is a merging of the best from the TV and app worlds.\n

25755	3710	3	3	Teens can find and listen to songs with profanity. If a user-created playlist has a swear word in its title, teens can type the word into the search tool, find the playlist, and listen to it.\n
25756	3710	4	2	Kids can learn a little about music and musical genres by exploring and listening to the playlists on Songza. Songza's extensive music collection gives teens access to a diversity of musical artists and styles and introduces them to the music of various cultures and time periods. Additionally, Songza helps teens identify their own emotions and think about how music can evoke certain moods. Songza would have more learning potential with enhancements like genre descriptions or artist bios. Still, the app engages listeners in exploring new music with its unique categories and clever playlist titles.\n
25757	3710	5	3	Teens can access songs with references to drinking, drugs, and smoking. The app's playlist categories include "Cocktail Party," "Drinking at a Dive Bar," and "Getting High."\n

DragonBox+ requires no prior knowledge of algebra or arithmetic, and only requires the ability to read the instructions that appear from time to time (or an adult to help read them).

Buttons are not explained, and while the tutorial (which is, in essence, mandatory) explains some of the game's basics, there's no guide on what to do next. Also, essential information is often hidden from sight unless the user scrolls down, which some people won't realize is an option. \n
25781	3714	1	2	Violence is certainly discussed, and there are onscreen flashes to simulate swordplay (and other attacks), but there's no blood or gore. Some of the characters shown on the game cards, however, are a bit too intense for young players. \n

When there's a killing, it's not overly gory, just a small explosion or alien green goo on the ground. Agents are "recruited" based on their ability in combat, physical skills, and intellect.\n

Gameplay starts off easy and builds slowly, giving players time to learn the ropes. To unlock the games, players have to earn a certain number of stars or medals. It's possible to unlock subsequent games without fully completing all the levels in the one before it, which is nice for players who get stumped by the tricky upper levels.\n
25802	3717	1	2	The groceries in Bag It! are characters who can be crushed when players put heavier items on top them. They shake and look scared when threatened, and some of them make a hurt sound and appear bruised when crushed.

When other pigs (who do not attempt to provoke the hero in any way) are killed, they explode into a rack of pork ribs, a BBQ sandwich, a can of SPAM, and their skulls.

25851	3724	1	2	Some photos or comments may contain violent material, but it's not widespread.\n
25852	3724	2	3	Despite terms that photos cannot be "nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive," several photos show cleavage and some comments are sexually explicit. \n
25853	3724	3	4	Several comments contain swear words, including "f--k." Comments are not moderated. Words also could be represented in photos; the terms do not prohibit specific language so long as it is not abusive toward another user. \n
25854	3724	4	2	Kids can learn some basic concepts about photography and exercise some creativity with Instagram. The service is designed to be an inherently social one, so teens using Instagram will learn some of the ins and outs (and perhaps ups and downs) of social networking. They'll have to make decisions about the kind of network they want to build and exercise judgment when they're communicating with others. Instagram isn't a deep learning experience, but it lets teens express themselves through photos as they build their social networks.\n

With 50 States, kids can also get a sense of timeline since the app tells the order in which each state joined the union. Kids can practice memorization by learning facts and then testing how much they were able to recall by taking quizzes. However, the quizzes are a missed opportunity to add additional fun and interactivity to the app. 50 States is a handy pocket reference guide with a limited capacity to let kids practice what they've learned.\n

Wubbzy's Pirate Treasure, an interactive book app, also lets kids practice reading, spelling, listening, and reading comprehension as they follow along with a pre-recorded narrative as words are highlighted, or read out loud by themselves. Wubbzy's Pirate Treasure is an engaging story that can help kids practice reading skills.\n

25872	3727	1	3	Essentially a gallery shooter, players shoot at wave after wave of trolls, knocking them off platforms. There is no blood or suffering, however. Generally players use projectiles to take out the trolls, but magic items like swords and falling anvils are used sometimes as well. \n

Kids can also learn to identify satellites and track their movement to get a sense of how fast the Earth spins. While there are several apps that discuss constellations, this one shows kids where they are -- with and without the artist embellishment, letting them find them on their own. The Night Sky takes a complex science and makes it easy to comprehend. \n

25886	3729	1	2	When birds make contact with an obstacle they disappear in a tuft of feathers, but they demonstrate no pain and seem perfectly willing participants in the mayhem. Defeated pigs disappear in a puff of smoke. If players burst the oxygen bubble around pigs that are floating in space, the pig will turn to ice and explode (representing what happens to life forms in space without protective equipment). Pigs that are damaged but not yet defeated display bruising.\n

25889	3729	4	3	Kids can learn about gravity, momentum, and trajectory with Angry Birds Space. The space setting teaches kids how small objects are affected by the gravitational pull of much larger objects such as planets. Kids can also observe how different physical surfaces are more or less destructible (ice, for example, is more breakable than rock), and use momentum to cause asteroids to ricochet off each other at different angles. Kids can link through to a NASA website with educational links and videos about gravity and the space station. Angry Birds Space may be set in a fantasy world, but it can teach plenty about real-world physics.\n

25892	3730	0	3	The game can be both easy or hard, depending on who your opponent is and the extent of his or her artistic abilities. If you're playing someone who can draw, it's sometimes easier to guess the object -- but if not, it can be challenging. \n
25893	3730	1	2	There's no violence in the game, but since it's entirely focused on user generated content, there's always the chance that other players could expose kids to violent imagery. "Bombs" eliminate letters to make guessing the object easier, but it's more for the visual effect than violent intent.\n
25894	3730	2	2	There's no overt sexuality in the game, but since it's entirely focused on user generated content, there's always the chance that other players could expose kids to provocative or lewd imagery.\n
25895	3730	3	2	There's no iffy language in the game, but since it's entirely focused on user generated content, there's always the chance that other players could write obscene words in their turn.\n
25896	3730	4	2	Kids can learn to improve their art and communication skills by sketching words in a creative way with Draw Something. Coming up with ways to make clues apparent isn't always easy, and kids will often find unique ways to accomplish this. They can learn to think differently as they guess what their collaborators have drawn. An interesting aspect is that players work together to achieve a streak of correct guesses, rather than against each other -- both parties want the other to guess the drawing.  Draw Something doesn't offer art instruction, but it does encourage kids to think differently as they express ideas through drawings. \n
25897	3730	5	2	Draw Something contains no alcohol, tobacco, or drugs in the game, but since it's entirely focused on user generated content, there's always the chance that other players could expose kids to these things.\n

Once a photo is selected, users move one or two circles over the target areas, adjust the size of the circles, then tap to "augment." The resulting augmentation can be further adjusted by cup size and brightness contrast. Pictures can be saved to the camera roll and shared via email, Facebook, Twitpic, Photobucket, or Flickr. Older, saved pictures cannot be shared without augmenting them again.\n
25914	3733	1	0	The app includes links to public photo sharing sites, including Google image search, Flickr, and Photobucket. Image search results could contain violent content.\n

25931	3735	4	1	While LEGO App4+ was created with educational intent, it appears to have limited learning potential. Kids can learn that LEGO parts can be put together to create a whole, but since it allows parts to be assembled as if in a 2-D puzzle (top part before bottom), it actually undermines building concepts. Kids will enjoy motoring their vehicles and jumping to collect coins, but they won't learn much. LEGO App4+ is cute and appealing but lacks accuracy in its primary skill: building.\n

A finger shaking back and forth in front of a wrapped gift shows them that they need to shake the gift to release objects to place. There's a sliding exit bar on the top right when they finish placing all the objects on the page; it's easy enough for kids to master and hard for them to exit the page by accident. Fun and easy extras include popping balloons, setting off firecrackers, and squashing bugs.\n

25948	3738	0	3	The app is easy to use. Ways to interact include "flirts," "ask me" questions, secret admirers, and messaging. Teens need to be proactive and use the privacy settings because the default settings could cause them to accept friend requests from people they don't know and agree to other features automatically. Teens need to visit the website to gain access to a wide range of privacy settings, including what ages can view your profile (the range you can choose from is based on your age). \n
25949	3738	1	0	The app itself does not include violent content, but what teens encounter will depend on the people they communicate with. MeetMe's terms bans threatening or abusive content.\n
25950	3738	2	3	There's no shortage of shirtless guy pics; women also pose in bikinis and underwear. Interaction here will likely include people teens don't know personally but are in the same zip code, state, or entire U.S., depending upon the settings users choose. MeetMe's terms ban images that contain "nudity (includes thongs and topless females from the back), pornography, sexually explicit, weapons, violence, or drugs." But a lot of photos and written posts are clearly sexually suggestive, even if they don't technically break the rules. A profile setting asks users to select whether they are looking for girls, boys, or both (not looking isn't an option). There is a "report abuse" feature on some forms of the network, but not all.\n
25951	3738	3	3	The terms ban language that is "unlawful; harmful; threatening; abusive; harassing; tortuous; defamatory; vulgar; obscene; libelous; invasive of another's privacy; hateful; or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable." But swear words are easily observed in the app. The forums and profiles aren't filtered on the site, so the site including profiles contains swear words like "f--k." Users can set a "hide profanity in live feed" block on the main site's settings.\n \n
25952	3738	4	4	The site uses "lunch money" to play games and other features; it can be purchased with real money or can be earned by doing certain things on the site, including sharing photos or information. Members get $150,000 worth of lunch money just for installing the app on their mobile device. There's a top-up credits feature that has to be deselected or will automatically top-up active accounts that have already purchased credits when they fall below 50 cents. VIP memberships can be purchased as well. There are ads in the app and on the website for everything from other apps to credit cards to Netflix.\n
25953	3738	5	3	The terms ban posts about illegal drinking and drugs, and there’s a "report abuse" feature, but references to drinking and partying are easily observed. Profile photos feature users clutching beer and swilling from a liquor bottle.\n \n

Kids also gain practice in counting by 5s, 10s, and 25s simply because of the values of the coins. Unless a parent is available to help, it helps if kids are already familiar with the values of each of the coins (nickels are worth 5 cents, for example).

25969	3741	0	3	While this game looks and feels a lot like the more sophisticated Sims games on the PC or consoles, it does strip away some of the more complex factors. For example, career ladders are less intensive, making it easier to climb to the top of a profession. There is also no option to have a child, meaning players will never have to deal with that added component. Nevertheless, players will need to have a firm grasp on time management and be able to juggle many tasks at the same time, taking this game slightly out of the realm of intently casual apps.\n
25970	3741	1	2	Among the many different social interactions that two or more Sims characters can have, it is possible to get into fist fights. Sims may also face violent hazards like fires and starvation, which can lead to death. While these actions are possible, they are never encouraged or rewarded.\n
25971	3741	2	3	As part of the realistic representation of real life, this game allows players to form relationships with other Sims characters. If players foster a relationship well enough, they will eventually earn the ability to have sex (called "woohoo!" in the game). This is presented as two Sims characters getting in the same bed. There is no graphic depiction of sexual activity, but it is heavily implied.\n
25972	3741	3	0	
25973	3741	4	2	Kids can learn about basic human needs from a somewhat simplistic viewpoint. Sim needs don't correspond exactly to scientific definitions of human need, but they're close. Teens can learn about working to nurture relationships as well as taking care of themselves. Simoleons (sim bucks), experience, and life point balances also help teens understand a little about living within one's means. The Sims FreePlay is a fun simulation that can introduce teens to the basics of day-to-day living, but it doesn't provide in-depth life lessons.\n

25977	3742	1	3	In Temple Run, you are chased by a pack of screaming monkeys. If they catch up to you, you'll become a "tasty snack" for the monkeys.

While the scoring is explained at the beginning of a game, while you're making words, you can't see the point value of letters, and at the end of the game, you can't see the point value of the words you made.\n

25986	3743	3	2	Words like "bitch" and "damn" are accepted.\n
25987	3743	4	3	Kids can learn spelling by building as many words as they can with colorful bouncing balls, each containing a letter. Letters shrink and then disappear if unused, so kids need to move fast. Words earn points based on the value assigned to each letter; longer words earn more. Kids won't see the point value while playing, so it's not easy to use it to their advantage. They also won't get help with misspellings. Kids can see a list of their words after the round, but no definitions. Word-building skills combine with arcade-style fun; learning value is limited.\n

25994	3744	4	3	Kids can learn to recognize more than 300 of the most common sight words in the English language. Sight Words Hangman is crafted after the old paper-and-pencil hangman game, but in this app, kids don't solve words letter by letter. Instead, after a word is spoken, kids select the correct word from a list of four written words. The target group is kindergartners and first-graders, as they are building word-recognition skills. Some words on the higher lists may be a stretch for the younger kids in this target age range. This spooky but clever twist on a classic can help young kids become fluent readers.\n

26011	3747	0	4	Overall this game is easy to play, because there aren't any rules. However, some kids might need a little help mastering the series of taps and drags that get the job done. Kids must explore to learn how to select a food and prepare it, but these steps are fairly intuitive. The graphics are quite compelling, particularly showing the food gradually browning as it's cooked in boiling water or on a steaming pan, even though the characters are animated very stylistically.\n

26015	3747	4	3	Kids can learn a little bit about cooking as they chop, blend, sauté, boil, and microwave a variety of foods. The app actually shows the color of the food changing as it boils or the pan hissing as it sautés, which offers a level of realism. Kids can also learn the types of diets preferred by various animals, for example, what a cat might or might not eat in contrast to the diet of a person or a bull. This activity could be a great conversation starter for parents and kids to talk about their favorite foods and about nutrition in general. Toca Kitchen is a simple and fun app for getting kids interested in and exploring food.\n

This fun word game helps kids dig into their existing vocabulary and challenges them to explore and discover new words. Kids can develop strategy skills as they try to make best use of the tiles for each game. For example, if there aren't many vowels, they'll have to make words with more consonants. Kids who enjoy puzzles and are self-motivated to learn can have lots of fun and pick up a little new vocabulary with Dabble.\n

26025	3749	0	3	There are a lot of controls on screen, making it sometimes hard to control actions. This is especially true for iPhone players. \n
26026	3749	1	5	Players can kill other humans, including police officers, or drive into pedestrians on sidewalks and parks. There are beatings, gang warfare, drive-by shootings, and bloody deaths, many shown in up-close detail. For example, players can drive on teh sidewalk, running over pedestrians at will or assault a pedestrian on the street, beating them to death to get money (or beating a police officer to death to get his weapon). \n
26027	3749	2	4	Prostitutes are prominent characters in the game, both as part of the story and non-player characters -- and they're dressed in low-cut apparel, true to the streetwalker cliche. You can gain "health points" by having implied sex with a prostitute in your car, where you hear what is happening and watch rhythmic actions of the couple from a distance, but don't actually see the act.\n
26028	3749	3	5	If you can think of it, you will hear it in this game. No obscenity is left unturned.\n
26029	3749	4	3	The game is part of a long-running franchise, and players may be moved to buy a more recent version of the game after playing this. This 10th anniversary edition also comes as the fifth installment of "Grand Theft Auto" is looming. \n

26047	3752	1	3	If the account has custom radio enabled, depending on which songs/artists users pick, stations could include songs that mention or glorify violence. Custom radio may be disabled in settings, but it's not possible to password-protect the setting.\n
26048	3752	2	3	If the account has custom radio enabled, depending on which songs/artists users pick, stations could include songs with sexual content. Custom radio may be disabled in settings, but it's not possible to password-protect the setting.\n
26049	3752	3	3	If the account has custom radio enabled, depending on which songs/artists users pick, stations could include songs with mature language. Custom radio may be disabled in settings, but it's not possible to password-protect the setting.\n
26050	3752	4	2	Kids can learn about local and world events through regional, news, and talk radio stations. The app’s ability to let users create stations based on their favorite musicians or songs is likely to be the biggest draw. However, if kids are willing to tune in to the available news coverage, they’ll learn about global happenings and news from more than 35 states. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any written materials -- which would help kids learn more about the topics that are discussed. Kids could learn about current events with iHeartRadio, but they'd need to make a special effort.\n

They can also practice a little time management, strategy, problem solving, and decision making. Kids will need to make decisions about whom to move into their tower (and whom to evict), how to staff their businesses so they'll run efficiently, and how spend their Tower Bux, which players earn slowly in-game or purchase with real money. Tiny Tower touches on thinking skills in a tiny but fun way.\n

26061	3754	1	3	Teens can create stations that will play songs with violent lyrics. Parents can enable the explicit content filter with a PIN; this will limit content to what would be played on daytime broadcast radio.\n
26062	3754	2	3	Teens can create stations that will play songs with sexual lyrics. Parents can enable the explicit content filter with a PIN; this will limit content to what would be played on daytime broadcast radio.\n
26063	3754	3	3	Teens can create stations that will play songs with mature lyrics. Parents can enable the explicit content filter with a PIN; this will limit content to what would be played on daytime broadcast radio.\n
26064	3754	4	2	Though the app isn't intended for learning, kids can learn about select song components -- such as minor key tonality -- via written info from the Music Genome Project, which tracks and compares song details. Kids can also read brief musician bios. \n
26065	3754	5	3	Teens can create stations that will play songs glorifying drinking drugs, and smoking. Enabling the explicit content filter will limit some but not all of this type of content.\n

26067	3755	0	3	The game's mechanics are well-explained and easy to grasp. Succeeding is largely a matter of timing and equipment -- though winning later matches without buying upgrades is very difficult.\n
26068	3755	1	4	Users are presented with a bloody Glu logo the first time they open the app. The game is a series of brutal battles featuring swords, maces, and more, though the app does not feature as much blood as you might expect. The screen does "splash" with blood when you are hit, however. Parents should note that two versions of the app are available for Android devices; the "unrated" Blood & Glory (NR) promises to be the "bloodiest, goriest swipe and slash fighting game" in the Android Market; this version is the equivalent of the iOS version. The regular Android version doesn't have blood.\n

26074	3756	0	4	Kids can learn a wide range of language and math skills, from recognizing lowercase and uppercase letters in alphabetical order to counting up through 20. Several puzzles challenge kids to identify patterns, finish sequences, and group similar objects, all while kids build the fine motor control to pinch and tap objects and drag them around the screen. The lively bugs and colorful buttons energize the puzzles and make the concepts more intuitive and relevant for kids to learn. Better progress tracking for parents would give the app a boost. Bugs and Buttons entertains and engages while it educates kids on basic skills.\n
26075	3756	1	1	In one game, kids aim bees at a target using a slingshot, but the bees are unhurt and in fact exclaim "yippee" and "yahoo" as they fly through the air. Another game involves tapping bugs to make them disappear in a burst of light.\n

With plenty of hints to help them along, kids can learn instead of just reinforcing what they already know. A section for parents to track how their children are doing would add to the app, but this also is a good age for kids to explore side-by-side with their parents. Team Umizoomi Math: Zoom into Numbers HD helps preschoolers learn math foundations in a tactile way while playing cute games and earning rewards.\n

26088	3758	0	1	The game offers no instruction or hints on what the object is. You're left to your own devices without any sort of instruction about either goals or how to build objects. Learning is done through exploration and experimentation, which creates a learning curve. Players can enable a "peaceful" mode, though, which eliminates any threats and lets them practice. \n
26089	3758	1	2	Players can combat monsters, but those can also be avoided. Player arsenals include a sword and arrows. While there is occasional combat, there is no gore -- and the game's intentionally blocky graphics further reduce the level of violence. Monsters disappear in a puff of smoke when they're killed. \n

Players can build essentially anything in this game, as long as they're able to mine the appropriate resources. That encourages not only creativity, but experimentation. Minecraft - Pocket Edition rewards imaginative thinking and may give kids a confidence boost as they show off the worlds they've created. \n

They can learn musical styles, composers, and instruments, and discover that classical compositions have specific names, moods, and can be heard in a variety of eras and settings. The app also has snippets of classical compositions that kids can listen to, complete with guided listening questions and suggestions. While the app is text-heavy and doesn't showcase any female or minority composers, the voiceover feature is great for introducing emerging readers to some of the most famous Western classical music composers of all time.\n

Also, parents may want to explain and guide their kids on the many options to share the drawings (via email, in-app gallery, device photos, or the app's Flickr account), as well as the in-app purchase feature.\n

26144	3766	0	4	The rules of the game have some intricacies, but play is introduced slowly with a tutorial that can be accessed at any time. Play is fairly challenging, and difficulty gradually increases with higher levels, though the games are not timed. The game is single-player only. Games can be played locally or saved to iCloud, then accessed from any device.\n
26145	3766	1	1	The definitions of some words include descriptions of or references to violence. \n
26146	3766	2	1	The definitions of some words include descriptions of or references to sex.\n
26147	3766	3	2	Swear words that have other meanings, such as "damn," can be played, and their definitions can be viewed.\n
26148	3766	4	3	Teens can learn some unique new words and improve their spelling in this fun word game. For the most part, players build words they're familiar with; however, when the letter tiles fall, words can automatically form -- some familiar, others not. If they choose to, players can tap on a word and read its definition. Teens also use strategy skills as they navigate the different types of tiles and try to stay under the number of tile swaps allowed in each round. W.E.L.D.E.R is a fun game that has the potential to help players learn new words, but they need to make a conscious effort to do so. \n
26149	3766	5	1	The definitions of some words include descriptions of or references to drinking, drugs, or smoking.\n
26150	3766	6	-1	
26151	3767	0	2	The controls are fairly intuitive, but the game is quite difficult after you've played through the introductory levels, which encourages people to buy in-game currencies. \n

When players level up, a hideous, detached zombie head rolls across the screen, staining it with blood. Players use a variety of firearms to defeat the undead, including pistols, rifles, and automatic weapons.\n

The sounds are fascinating: Who knew a crocodile chitters? There's some disconnect between the cartoonish graphics (except the chimpanzee for some reason) and the quite real vocalizations. The Quiz section omits the written names, and the sounds are optional. Animal Book teaches kids the names of different animals and the sounds they make but only half-heartedly incorporates text and real vocalizations in the game. \n

The Learn section gives kids the opportunity to recognize the written names of shapes and numbers, but this skill is omitted from the Quiz section. Alphabet Book achieves its simple learning goal well -- shape, number, and letter naming -- but misses out on opportunities to incorporate more learning.\n

26173	3770	1	5	There's nonstop violence in the game, with copious amounts of blood. When your player is shot, the screen turns red with blood splatters, and head shots of enemy soldiers are often shown in slow motion. Players can also slit enemy throats with knives.

Strategizing several steps ahead is a must. After the first few (rather easy) levels, kids will probably need many attempts to successfully save the flies. The app is stingy with hints -- given by time played -- and the tutorial gives no strategies. Greedy Spiders is a fun and challenging puzzle game that really tests patience, strategy, and logic.\n

26190	3772	4	2	Kids can learn strategy and practice counting by seeing the number of stones in a house then counting in sequence to see where their handful of stones will end. Depending on the situation with that last stone, kids decide which house to move. The strategy lies in thinking ahead and being on the lookout to capture or avoid capture. There are three levels of difficulty, three to six stones to start, and live or online opponents. Mancala: FS5 is one of many classic mancala games with lots of play options but not the best help features. \n

The games cover concepts and skills including classifying objects by color, size and more; identifying patterns; charting data (in a simple, age-appropriate way); sequencing; and counting practice. The app also explains some science-related vocabulary words. Sid's Science Fair gently teaches core science ideas and inspires young scientists in fun, effective ways.\n

The interactive book offers minimal content -- comparable to a pop-up or touch-and-feel book -- but young preschoolers who are fans of the book or monsters will enjoy the app. It's a gentle, easy-to-use way to help kids face their fears -- monster or otherwise. \n

If the object doesn't do the job, they can keep trying until they find one that does. Kids are validated for choices that could work even if they aren't the best possible answers. Scribblenauts Remix is a welcome departure from the true/false, right/wrong framework that can make kids feel boxed in and limited.\n

Kids must watch the motion of the dragon and decide when best to descend and when to release to match the contour of the "realm." It might be a better message if the dragon was leading mom on an adventure rather than flying away. If mama catches you, back to the nest!

Kids select objects that flash and are given three letter choices. If "b" is selected for "bird" they get stars. If "s" is selected for "bird" they see a picture of a sand castle, hear "sand castle starts with s," and get to try again. The only issue is that sometimes the objects kids need to click on are small and hard to see -- especially when a bunny is flashing white on a white background. Luckily, if it's not found after flashing for a bit it will pop up anyway.\n

26438	3808	0	2	This game is based on the complex and highly nuanced Neuroshima Hex board game. Players will need to be familiar with the board game to be able to jump right into the action. Those who are not will face a steep learning curve before they can appreciate the high level of strategy required to excel in the game. Players can choose from between three difficulty levels for their computer opponents.\n
26439	3808	1	2	The goal of this game is for players to knock out their opponents' armed troops. However, everything is presented in the form of a tabletop board game -- that is, instead of shooting or attacking characters, board game tokens move around and are taken out of play when they are defeated. The word "Battle!" frequently appears on the screen, and there are images of people holding guns and of environmental destruction, but there is no interactive violence.\n

26442	3808	4	1	Neuroshima Hex wasn't created with educational intent, and we don't recommend it for learning. The app, like the board game, gives kids opportunities to apply complex information while strategizing the best way to defeat enemy armies.

There's also a pre-recorded presentation, but the option to watch that at any time is not readily apparent on the app; it seemingly only shows up when connection to the webcam is lost or buffering takes too long.\n

They can also learn some penguin facts if they tune in to watch a California Academy of Sciences biologist make a presentation at the exhibit twice daily (10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. PST). Pocket Penguins is an interesting way to view a live penguin exhibit, but the app doesn't include much information or interactivity.\n

There's always more than one way to complete a level, and kids are encouraged to experiment until they find the solution that earns them the most stars.

26557	3825	0	3	While this game seems simple enough, it's surprisingly difficult for younger kids to play because it can be tricky for little fingers to hit the right tiny coffin out of which the zombies and angels appear. They're spaced very closely, and even the initial game speed in easy mode is rather quick.\n
26558	3825	1	3	Hitting zombies (and avoiding hitting angels) that appear out of coffins is the premise of the game. When users hit "Play" on the main screen, it prompts the first whack of a mallet, and a zombie with blood pouring down his face appears. In the game itself, zombies don't bleed when hit, but instead lose their eyes.\n

26579	3828	1	2	As odd as it sounds, this is a violent word game. That is, as players solve word puzzles on the bottom of the screen, enemy creatures are shown being attacked on the top. The damage is shown in a still picture/icon with bursts and explosions signifying attacks. Each attack reduces the enemy's health bar and players must fully deplete that bar before their own time runs out.\n

Even for toddlers, however, the simple step of tapping on a screen with little direction and some nonsensical results (animals falling through the sky into an environment in which they're not naturally found together; game point totals in the hundreds and thousands that would mean nothing to a toddler) doesn't lead to meaningful learning.

The field guide can be a bit confusing, but the steps for submitting a new spotting are clearly explained. Explanations of the project, missions, and earning patches are located on the corresponding website.

If they join the app's missions, they can learn the real-life work of biologists and ecologists by helping track a particular species or adding to a catalog of data about a neighborhood or region. In addition, the community structure of the app helps kids build important collaboration skills. Project Noah gives kids a chance to do real-world, scientific fieldwork with the support of a knowledgeable and global community.\n

26662	3840	0	4	This is a casual puzzle game. It is not difficult to play, but it is tough to master. Players have to change a grid filled with different-colored "globs" into one giant single-colored glob by changing the colors of each glob one at a time. The challenge comes in that players can only adjust colors a certain amount of times before the level is over, so the idea is to find globs that, when changed, will also change the nearby same-colored globs. It takes a couple tries to get the hang of it, but for the most part it is an easily graspable concept.\n

As the game progresses, a small bit of strategy emerges as kids must try to cover the entire grid within a certain number of turns: If I choose purple now, will I have to choose it again before the puzzle is complete? Unfortunately, there is no tutorial or hints so higher-level strategy is not guaranteed. Globs is an engaging way to get kids counting and grouping, but your littlest ones might need a few pointers.\n

There is no built-in dictionary to help teens expand vocabulary or solve the puzzles, so they must rely on their current knowledge or look for guidance outside the app. Building words gives them a little practice with math skills, and the social media component offers teens the opportunity to demonstrate safe and responsible online behavior. Hanging With Friends is a social word game that mixes a little spelling practice with a lot of fun.\n

Kids learn phonics blending for three-letter words in a puzzle game. This app is much more fun and interactive than its simpler companion app, Kids ABC Letters, and more effective in moving kids along the path to reading.

All of these pre- and early-reading skills help kids ease into reading.

They'll see that while some of the liquid flows one direction, some also spills, and they'll find a way to stop or minimize the spills. Players use logic and knowledge gained from previous levels to use the tools provided to direct the oil and prevent the spills. The premise of the game also teaches that, while oil is essential in making things work, it can harm the environment. Feed Me Oil is an entertaining way for kids to use creative problem-solving and physics concepts to solve the puzzles.\n

26718	3848	0	3	The app is easy enough to use aside from occasional glitches, such as closing unexpectedly. The overall design can be a bit confusing and there are no tutorials or explanations to help. For one, it may confuse some users that the words on the word list have difficulty scores, but users cannot change them; the app actually ranks the words automatically based on users' performance on practice questions and tests. In the beginning, all words are ranked as a 10. Teens can choose the difficulty level of words to practice in the settings, but until they have spent some time with the app, this option doesn't filter the words accurately. The ability to email yourself and the automatic scoring of the quiz are useful features. The length of the practice is determined by the user.\n

Most words will be challenging for teens, such as "zeitgeist" and "salient," but a few words are don't seem like SAT-level vocabulary; for example, "writing" is on the list. The word list has navigation tabs for all letters of the alphabet, but there are only words that start with A-E, S, W, Y, and Z. Though limited in customization and far from comprehensive, IntelliVocab for SAT is a fine supplement to teens' SAT prep routines.\n

The simple puzzles in which segments of letters are scrambled for kids to drag and snap in place to form the letter is almost too easy even for preschoolers. One game helps kids learn to identify letters by asking them to pick out one specific letter from inside words. The app doesn't teach the phonetic sounds of letters.

For example, on the Color Quiz, kids are instructed to find a yellow balloon; if they tap the green balloon it disappears and the app says," Try again." It does not provide toddlers with the color of the balloon they just tapped incorrectly or restate what color they should be finding. Also, on drawing letters, kids can trace anything over the letters and not be corrected. Some learning can happen in Toddler World, but so can frustration and errors.\n

It is easy to learn new words with this app. A new word is available every day, and up to three more words can be viewed daily. The audio voices sound natural and pleasant.

26803	3860	1	2	Some cartoons depict weapons or violence, but they are not animated or graphic. Explanations of some words, such as "abusive" and "masochist," discuss issues of violence.\n
26804	3860	2	2	Cartoons for words like "licentious" and "voluptuous" have cartoonishly curvy women in tight clothes. The contextualizing sentences for some words discuss romantic and sexual situations, e.g. the licentiousness of Roman orgies.\n
26805	3860	3	2	The synonyms lists for the words can include some slang and vulgur language, for example, "p---y whipped" is listed as a synonym for uxorious. In addition, the contextual stories that explain each word often bring in issues that go beyond the definition. For example, one definition expresses surprise that a man would be so uxorious to a wife who "certainly wasn't attractive." Elsewhere, the causes and effects of abuse and abasement are discussed. In some places, these explanations also use uncommon or improper grammar. While the down-to-earth, casual tone might appeal to teens, it's surprising in a vocabulary tool.\n
26806	3860	4	3	Kids can learn challenging new vocabulary by studying the daily words and testing themselves with the quiz feature. The app provides many elements known to help teens expand vocabulary including visuals, audio, synonyms and antonyms, a paragraph for added context, and a quiz to check learning. Unfortunately, the app doesn't provide any way for teens to create sentences or illustrations, which would enable them to make deeper connections to the new words. Word A Day Visuals and Audios by VocabAhead exposes teens to challenging vocabulary words with plenty of context but would be more valuable if there were activities to apply the learning.\n

There's also the option to hear the name of the completed puzzle's object spoken ("clock," "dog"), thereby building the vocabulary of young kids still building a basic word bank.

26831	3864	1	3	Players defend against waves of oncoming raiders on foot and in vehicles using gun turrets, mortars, lasers, cannons, and flame-throwers. Combat is a central theme but there's no graphic violence. The narrative describes other soldiers being killed.\n

26837	3865	0	2	Aside from a handful of simple mini-games, the game is menu-driven and requires no reflexes. The app lacks an in-app tutorial and fails to adequately explain the gameplay and goals. In the Shoutbox message area, there is a link to a help guide for the game; it is viewed in an outside browser window.\n
26838	3865	1	3	Text descriptions encourage players to "bring out [the dog's] killer instinct" and\n"give it a taste for blood." Players can buy knives and guns to defend\nthemselves; the developer's help guide says the guns are for "fighting the police during a bust and they build street cred." In one mini-game players teach\n a growling dog to bite by yanking on a rope. The main menu shows a dog with blood on its snout; no graphic violence is shown visually.  Dogfights are menu-driven with damage indicated through a decreasing health bar.\n
26839	3865	2	3	The Shoutbox in-game message board may contain posts from other players with sexual references.\n
26840	3865	3	4	There is no strong language in the content of the game, although a diamond collar is captioned with "I'm rich, bioootch!" The Shoutbox in-game message board contains posts from other players that are peppered with trash talk that includes "s--t," "f--k," "ass" and so on.\n

Presented as a story about a group of friends, this book app creates an authentic narrative to which the kids of the targeted age can identify.

As an aside, kids get exposure to some amazing visual combinations of shapes as they complete each of the 1,000 levels.

Main instructions are written for each level, but there are some features that players just need to figure out intuitively as the game goes along. You need to complete a level for the game to save it.\n
26880	3871	1	2	The main premise of the game is a battle of four pig heroes against pig devils from the underworld who are trying to destroy the world. A pig hero named War Pig has the superpower of firing cannons into enemies. \n

26900	3874	0	4	For a run-and-gun game, the controls and gameplay are relatively simple. A lot of the action takes place from a far-away range, allowing players to snipe their victims from a distance that minimizes their danger. However, in the instances where there are a lot of enemies on the ground or at close combat, it can be a bit cumbersome to shoot down everyone.\n
26901	3874	1	4	As a hit man, players kill people, from a first-person perspective, using a wide arsenal of sniper guns, assault rifles, and other firearms to carry out their murderous tasks. They are encouraged to shoot people in the head. Sometimes, but not always, when players shoot down enemies there is a puff of blood.\n
26902	3874	2	0	
26903	3874	3	1	There is very little in the way of in-game dialogue, so cursing is not an issue. However, the brevity of the killing missions and flippant directions to "kill" people may be unsettling for some.\n
26904	3874	4	5	Do not be mistaken by the fact that this game is marketed as a "free" app. The game constantly prompts players to download additional levels, weapons, and in-game currency. These transactions range from $1.99 to $49.99.\n

26915	3876	1	2	The game involves placing bombs on a building and blowing it up. There is a panda character that appears to be a stuffed animal. If you place a bomb on the panda, it's blown into pieces. You lose points for blowing up the panda.\n

26928	3878	0	4	The game features six sets of puzzles (each 30 levels), using the same (now familiar) gameplay of the original game. The first set is incredibly simple, though, and doesn't present much challenge until the final two or three levels. From there, the difficulty begins to ramp up.\n
26929	3878	1	2	Cartoon birds fling themselves via slingshot to decimate wood, glass, and stone obstacles to free their caged bird companions or take out marmosets.\n

They are limited to only a few choices in terms of color and line thickness, but the chalk and sponge eraser have a realistic look. The ability to send a final product with an audio recording is well-integrated into the program so even little kids will be able to figure it out, though parents will want to monitor sharing. Bord is a simple chalk drawing program that provides an interesting playback feature for budding artists.\n

26985	3886	1	2	The beetle hero can die in several cartoonish ways -- being crushed by a falling rock or acorn, freezing in cold air, falling into lava, or getting vaporized by the hot desert sun.

Four levels provide a range of challenge; it takes serious perseverance and resets to figure out some, while ohers come easily. Solitaire Chess is a great starting point for kids who want to build chess and memory skills.\n

27033	3893	0	4	The main menu presents five games that are intuitive and easy to play, although the train tracks game may be challenging for younger children. There are no instructions included, but most young children will be able to figure the games out with only minimal assistance.\n

27037	3893	4	3	Kids can learn prereading skills by matching shapes and letters and puzzle pieces. Zoo Train is geared to preschoolers, offering simple activities that require no instruction. Each activity can be completed quickly, just right for a preschooler's attention span. Incorrect moves just don't stick, so kids are motivated to keep trying. The praise such as "Good job" and "You’re good at this" after kids complete tasks would be more effective if it were more specific. Preschoolers will enjoy the puzzles and praise, and parents will be happy with the high-quality, age-appropriate activities.\n

27047	3895	0	3	The game has 10 difficulty levels, and even the lower settings offer quite a challenge, because enemy waves can come from different directions and there's no preview of what enemy types are coming up next. The drag-and-drop interface used to place towers, upgrade them, and sell them is intuitive and clear.\n
27048	3895	1	2	Combat is a central theme; however, there is no graphic violence. Players use machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and mortars to combat waves of tanks, helicopters, and marching robots.\n

27062	3897	1	2	When birds make contact with an obstacle they disappear in a tuft of feathers, but they demonstrate no pain and seem perfectly willing participants in the mayhem. Defeated pigs disappear in a puff of smoke. Pigs that are damaged but not yet defeated display bruising.\n

Kids can also learn -- albeit superficially -- about different cultural traditions and festivals, from Chinese New Year to Easter to Halloween. Kids can get a feel for physics concepts through puzzle-solving against fun seasonal backdrops.\n

Monitoring time, income, environment, population, and happiness statistics, kids slowly build, maintain, and upgrade commercial, residential, and civic enterprises. Details and data are engaging but often hard to see on smaller screens. Virtual City is a powerful sim that gives kids opportunities to engage in simple simulated business and civic management.\n

The app offers challenges for a wide range of math abilities, even within each skill. Kids can choose the range of numbers (like sums to eight) within the skill, and they can also test combined skills such as addition and subtraction or multiplication and division. Kids can also choose easy, medium, or hard for the challenge level. Math Blaster Hyperblast adds fun and excitement to the important business of practicing math facts.\n

27117	3905	0	3	The difficulty of the puzzles increases rather quickly (Puzzle #2 is actually a bit of a challenge), but while it's tough to get a gold medal, it's usually not too hard to score bronze and, thus, move on in the game. Since you control the game by turning your device, it's easier to play on a small phone than a bulkier tablet.\n
27118	3905	1	2	The burning of the ropes isn't necessarily violent, but your flame will also burn up little colorful bugs that are climbing on the rope (for which you get bonus points).\n
27119	3905	2	0	
27120	3905	3	0	
27121	3905	4	2	Kids can learn to make decisions about where to begin burning the rope, strategize about where to send the flame, and investigate with as many tries as they wish. They learn that fire generally burns up and develop manual dexterity rotating the device to keep the flame going. The various designs are entertaining -- pineapples, snails, leaves –- but the developers could have chosen something besides cute and colorful insects to burn. Designs are endlessly challenging and no burn happens the same way twice. Burn the Rope is an engaging way for kids to practice using a bit of strategy as well as dexterity to solve puzzles.\n

27128	3906	4	3	Kids can learn to identify dinosaurs by name and era in Dinosaurs 360. Kids can develop their memory skills as they view the images of each dinosaur and its name and can test that memory in the quiz. Kids will use spatial reasoning skills to piece an image of a dinosaur back together in the puzzle component. The images are realistic, and kids interested in dinosaurs will enjoy seeing them beautifully rendered in their habitat. While Dinosaurs 360 is a visually engaging app, some kids may prefer a more multisensory experience.\n

27131	3907	0	4	World of Goo has always been easy to learn but hard to master, and the same is true of the mobile edition. However, the touch interface, which replaces the mouse and the Wii remote in the original editions for PC and Wii, is exceptionally intuitive, and could make it even easier for players to get into the swing of manipulating the game's goo balls.\n
27132	3907	1	1	The game’s goo balls -- which, thanks to their googly eyes, appear to be alive -- can perish by, say, falling through openings in the floor, touching flames, or getting popped by spinning machinery. They don’t appear to suffer.\n

27135	3907	4	4	Kids can learn physics and engineering concepts and at the same time improve analytical thinking skills. In order to build structures that won't collapse, kids have to consider things like weight, gravity, tension, and friction. Since each puzzle limits the number of goo balls players can use, kids are challenged to analyze each situation and think strategically as they build. World of Goo empowers kids to learn through discovery as they experiment with the rules of structural physics and engineering.\n

27174	3913	1	2	You can punch and slap Santa by tapping and swiping his face. This is accompanied by realistic sounds, but no blood or bruising. If you ask for a present immediately after doing this, Santa gets angry and stomps on the present instead of opening it for you. You can also tap a snowball icon to cause a huge snowball to roll over Santa and knock him over.\n
27175	3913	2	1	If you poke Santa in the crotch he'll double up and groan. If you click on the Postcard icon, you'll see an animation of Santa turning around and pulling down his pants to reveal red polka-dotted underwear with "Merry Christmas" written across the backside.\n
27176	3913	3	0	The only thing Santa says on his own is "ho  ho ho," but through the voice recognition feature, he can be made to repeat anything that's spoken into the microphone, including offensive language.\n
27177	3913	4	3	An ever-present icon in the upper right corner of the screen lists other apps in the "Talking Friends" collection, and clicking any of the icons takes you to the iTunes purchase page.\n

27188	3915	1	5	The entire game drips with blood. Every slash and slice of the hero's sword leaves huge splatters of red across the gameworld. Combo attacks can sever limbs and heads, and even slice enemies' bodies clean in half. Some of the goriest bits occur during the comic-book style story sequences.\n

The monster is defeated by a dentist character removing its teeth (only the aftermath of this is shown). The most potentially traumatic part of the original television special -- in which the heroic Yukon Cornelius falls from a cliff and is falsely presumed dead -- has been removed from this retelling of the story.\n

27222	3920	0	2	You roll the die to pick a category, and then try to guess what Lego structure is being built before time runs out by tapping on one of four choices. The game lasts for 15 puzzles, or until you make an incorrect choice or choose too slowly. However, the touch screen isn't quite responsive enough -- sometimes we had to tap several times to select a choice. And the structure is built so fast and the time to select is very short, making this a hard game to win.\n

27245	3923	2	1	There is almost no sexual content in the game, but it does make reference to "booth babes." Although it's not really portrayed in the game, they are usually skimpily/sexily clad women who work at trade shows selling/demonstrating products.\n
27246	3923	3	0	
27247	3923	4	2	Kids can learn to read and follow directions, monitor monetary and human resources, and discover some of the aspects of managing a game development company. Kids must persevere and monitor timelines while handling the stress of low sales or so-so reviews. Kids can decide whether to develop a new game, do contract work, or change their usual genre. Game Dev Story is a moderately engaging sim app that might spark some business enthusiasm in dedicated gamers.\n

27251	3924	1	2	The cartoon man makes angry gestures and worried looks as he appears. When you lose, a hooded hangman appears and pulls the lever -- the hanged man drops through a trapdoor and isn't visible when he dies.\n

27253	3924	3	0	While players can enter any word (even nonsensical words) in the two-player mode for each other to guess, the included words in the one-player mode are unobjectionable.\n
27254	3924	4	1	Although Doodle Hangman Free was created with some educational intent, we don't recommend it for learning. The vocabulary varies greatly in difficulty, and there are no settings options nor hints to adapt the learning experience.

Kids can increase their vocabulary, learn some phonics through letter puzzles, and learn to associate spoken names with written words. Additional puzzles using geometric shapes, downloadable puzzles, and menu control would provide added learning, flexibility, and control.

27289	3929	4	3	Kids can learn logical progression, spatial reasoning, and problem solving. This adaption of the classic sliding block puzzler Rush Hour offers four levels of challenge -- easy, medium, hard, and expert. The tutorial is excellent, and the hint button shows kids the next move if they need help. One amazing feature is the solve button, which shows step-by-step how to solve the puzzle. It may feel like cheating, but on the more advanced levels, kids will still be challenged to solve the puzzle even after seeing the solution. Rush Hour is an engaging puzzle game with great help features that make it even better than the original.\n

Telling stories on the spot requires kids to practice improvisational speaking, which can help improve their confidence and comfort in other public speaking situations.

Geometrical concepts like symmetry and asymmetry, timing (based on counting squares), and color mixing make for a concept-packed experience. Levels named after Canadian provinces provide a bit of geography icing on the top. Though trains crash, kids won't be tempted to smash 'em up just for fun ('cuz it isn't). Trainyard is a superb combination of real-world learning and play for train enthusiasts or anyone who loves a challenge.\n

During gameplay, they strategically cut ropes tethered to a piece of candy with the goal of depositing the candy into the monster's open mouth while collecting as many bonus stars as possible. There's always more than one way to complete a level, and kids are encouraged to experiment until they find the solution that earns them the most stars.

Each puzzle challenges kids to study the whole to see where blocks can and can't fit. The system keeps track of multiple individual players, and stats include time spent playing -- wow, what parent doesn’t want that information! Make sure to set up users ahead of time to avoid losing solutions. Doodle Fit is an excellent geometric puzzle app with cool features and awesome flexibility.\n

27359	3939	4	2	Kids can learn the joys of caring for, breeding, collecting, selling, and trading beautifully rendered, imaginary frog species. Gameplay is largely hopping around lily pads in the pond eating dragonflies -- yikes, 27 percent happy? Time for a trip to the pond! Players monitor the health of their frogs and can sell them when habitats get too crowded, buy frogs with virtual coins, or trade to complete a collection. Incorporating real species and their names would provide a powerful learning boost. Pocket Frogs is a sophisticated collecting app with gorgeous graphics and some hopping-good action, too.\n

27384	3943	1	2	The entire concept of the game revolves around pushing a wooden dummy down a long flight of stairs. It is obviously a dummy, but it "breaks bones" as it falls. Its body parts turn red as they get damaged and "broken bone" icons appear; you also hear crunching and snapping sounds. Plus, you can use your device's photo album to place a real person's face on the dummy.\n

27401	3945	4	3	Kids can learn to recognize letters, numbers, and animal images and their name sounds. Toddlers hear stylized animal sounds and create animal collages that can be saved to the device camera (though Android version of this function is buggy). A bonus ABC song game has a very cool built-in metronome (drum picture), but with only one beat that's a little too fast. Number and animal words would provide an additional learning boost. Giraffe's PreSchool Playground is a fun app that toddlers will love for basic letter and number name recognition.\n

27495	3959	0	4	The game requires touching items and using simple drag and drop. Each activity starts with short verbal instructions, but younger children may need some parental guidance to understand what is going on. There is only one level of play throughout, so younger users will find some of the tasks more challenging, while older users will find some too easy. Parents can't select which activities are available to play -- they appear randomly.\n

They don't have the ability to select their activities, so they can't focus on areas where they need help, but they probably won't mind cycling through all of the games. There isn't much depth to Monkey Preschool Lunchbox, but it is engaging for the young kids it targets.\n

27511	3961	2	4	There are loads of sexual images among these photographs. Most are comical images that are not inherently sexual in nature, but look sexual based on the context or the angle of the photograph. Others are blatantly sexual, and some even contain partial nudity.\n
27512	3961	3	5	In randomly browsing the photos, you can come across images containing just about any swear word you can think of. Profanity is not involved in the majority of the images, but you never know when it will pop up.\n

Duck Duck Moose took what used to be just a fun sing-along and uses the lyrics and setting of the song to create an activity where kids can explore and learn. The most obvious source of learning comes from a charming tutor, who happens to be a fly. She can answer questions about nature and the environment like, "Where does rain come from?" Other interactive elements range from more learning-oriented ones like counting to silly ones, like stacking hats. For a short song, Itsy Bitsy Spider – by Duck Duck Moose packs a punch.\n

The app incorporates a bingo game into the math practice, so kids can also improve their strategy skills a little as they play. Math Bingo doesn't offer any constructive feedback or instruction, so it won't help kids deepen their understanding of math concepts, but it's a useful tool for practicing math operations.\n

The app features one video every day (although kids can browse topically to watch others anytime), and kids can take a quiz after each video. Quizzes are designed to help kids not only retain the content in the videos but also practice vocabulary and reasoning skills. BrainPOP Featured Movie provides well-presented material on many topics that kids learn about in school.\n

More specifically, the game focuses on an important concept related to a law of motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This becomes apparent as kids tap different areas of their orb to control its forward and backward motion. Learning is informal, and kids won't get concrete lessons that are heavy in content. Instead, with Osmos, kids get an opportunity to explore physics concepts through direct touch interaction.\n

So it covers just about everything, including a little reading in the storytelling game many pre-readers will need parents' help with that game over the others. Kids interact most when they trace letters; beyond that there's a missed opportunity for more fun ways to engage kids overall.

Different plants do different sorts of damage to different types of zombie attackers, so players must deduce which qualities each plant has. Clicking on sunlight that drops in the yard gives kids points so they can buy new plants. Budgeting is also a skill kids can practice here, since they have a limited amount of resources to build defensive units. Plants vs. Zombies is a goofy exercise in strategy and planning.\n

27727	3992	1	1	The violence is all perpetrated against fruit. With your fingers as sword, you'll slice through watermelons, kiwis, strawberries, and the like. Bombs appear as well, and accidentally slicing a bomb means the end of your game. There is no explosion; just a bright flash of light.\n

The D-Pad (press the direction you want to go) and swipe method (run your finger in the direction you want to travel) both work very well. The tilt method might be fun for novelty value, but it's far too glitchy to use for actually playing the game.\n

By translating the lyrics into functional, interactive features, kids can see and do what the lyrics say. Further, kids are exposed to different languages and instruments. Wheels on the Bus takes a classic, just-for-fun sing-along and makes the learning a bit more active, but not especially deep.\n

There are now 240 levels. The Mighty Eagle makes things easier, though, in that you can use the giant bird as a sort of cheat to get past levels that have you otherwise stumped.\n
27776	3999	1	2	Cartoony birds launch themselves out of slingshots to break through wood, glass, and stone obstacles -- and ultimately to flatten evil pigs. When the pigs are defeated, they disappear in a puff of smoke. If they are damaged by falling debris, but not entirely destroyed, the pigs will develop bruised, black eyes. Available as an in-app purchase is the Mighty Eagle character -- a giant bird that crashes down to smash pretty much everything onscreen.\n

Since the app does most of the calculating automatically, kids don't do as much adding and subtracting as in the board game. However, they still must do calculations to determine which properties to mortgage or what to offer in trades. Additionally, kids can develop strategy skills as they try to amass more wealth than their opponents.

27953	4024	3	0	
27954	4024	4	3	Kids can learn to assess personal, academic, and social situations, then make decisions to impact those situations. By reading dialogue, tweens see strengths and weaknesses, build friendships or ignore them, handle stress, and get around obstacles like cheerleaders who hate them because of their shoes. Episodes can drag, and though the abundant dialogue is scarily realistic at times, personalities are mostly stereotypical. Surviving High School gives tweens an entertaining glimpse at high school life but falls a bit short on sophistication and pace.\n

27956	4024	6	-1	
27957	4025	0	5	The touch screen lends itself perfectly to the famous falling puzzle pieces, and the new One-Touch mode offers an even easier and less frantic variation on traditional gameplay.\n

27961	4025	4	3	Kids can learn about geometry and shapes, as well as how to recognize patterns. Tetris also makes kids think about spatial relationships as they rotate and move different falling blocks so that they interlock together on a square grid. This simple yet ingenious puzzle game has appeal for players of all ages and abilities. If kids choose one of the more challenging modes, they'll exercise thinking and reasoning skills with Tetris.\n

27968	4026	4	1	While THE GAME OF LIFE shows kids a little bit about life choices and budgeting, we don't recommend it for learning.\n
27969	4026	5	0	
27971	4027	0	4	The tutorial, which covers the basics, is very helpful. After that, a status bar reporting your Sim's needs will tell you whether to hit the shower next or get him a job. Lost in town? Tap a button to locate your Sim at any time.\n
27972	4027	1	1	If you've given your Sim a temper, he might kick over a trash can or act out in some other mildly anti-social way.\n
27973	4027	2	3	Sims can fall in love and kiss. Their relationships can also progress to where they dive under the sheets to engage in "Who-hoo" (game's term), accompanied by giggles and hearts.\n
27974	4027	3	0	Sims speak to one another in an indecipherable gibberish that rises and falls with emotion.\n
27975	4027	4	3	Kids can learn about time and resource management with The Sims 3. The app is a simulation of real life, and puts teens in control of decisions such as how much time to spend working, socializing, taking care of their hygiene, and other parts of life. Teens will decorate a virtual house using the money they earn in the game; they'll need to learn how to manage their funds without excessive spending. The app also shows players that their decisions have consequences. The Sims 3 lets teens make life decisions, observe the consequences, and reflect -- all in a simulated and therefore low-stakes environment.\n

27978	4028	0	4	Kids will get a kick out of tapping on the barn door to reveal animals. Parents might wish for a way to select specific animals to review, rather than have to go through the entire game to see them again.\n

27982	4028	4	2	Kids can learn the names for popular barn animals. The language options give kids, and even parents, the opportunity to learn vocabulary in Spanish and other languages. While kids may already be familiar with cows and horses, parents can focus on the names, pronunciation, spelling of the words, and animal sounds. Though this simple game doesn't give kids feedback on their learning, parents can fill that need by making Peekaboo Barn a parent-child activity.\n

27985	4029	0	4	Navigating to a geocache is easy. The app shows your current location connected to the treasure by a dotted line with directional arrows and distance measured in feet. As you get closer, keeping an eye on the arrows and feet left tell you whether you've passed the mark. Afterward, you can log your comments right from the field.\n

27996	4030	4	3	Kids can learn a little vocabulary and spelling with this fun word game. As players try to find words to fill the egg crates, they are encouraged to push themselves to make longer words. If players want to know the meaning of a word, they can tap on it to pause the game and access an online search for the term. Players who are interested in learning new words will benefit from the word review option at the end of each game. Chicktionary is an entertaining word game that can build vocab and spelling skills for players who make that a priority.\n

27999	4031	0	5	Electronic Arts left no stone unturned in decking this game out with conveniences. Instantly recall tiles when a word doesn't work out. Rearrange the rack by shaking the phone. The "best word" tool keeps four freebies on hand for when you get stuck. Wonder if you could have done better? Tap Teacher to see what the CPU would have played. The only flaw is that random Facebook matchups take too long to set up.\n

28003	4031	4	3	Kids can learn vocabulary words and spelling as they strategically place their tiles to form words with the highest points. And they'll need to use math to maximize their scores. The Scrabble app is an adaptation of the board game and can be even more enjoyable with its smart, intuitive design and features. A teacher feature can be turned on to recommend the word that would have gotten you the most points after each turn. Kids have the option of playing with friends using Facebook Connect or challenging random opponents. Scrabble improves upon the traditional board game for learning vocab and spelling.\n
28004	4031	5	0	
28005	4031	6	-1	
28006	4032	0	3	Overall game play is easy, just without Scrabble's frills. Tile recall and shuffle are both convenient. There are no free words, tips, or hints.\n
28007	4032	1	0	
28008	4032	2	0	
28009	4032	3	2	Some of the words allowed in the game are surprisingly iffy. Also, chat is unmoderated and can't be turned off, so it is possible to be exposed to offensive language from an opponent.\n
28010	4032	4	2	Kids will learn how important it is to have a broad and deep vocabulary base and strong spelling skills to play Words With Friends well. The Scrabble clone, which doesn't give clues or give kids access to a dictionary, encourages kids to test their skills against opponents (their friends or random players, so they'll need to act responsibly), and kids can use strategy and math concepts to maximize scores. While kids can pick up new words and spellings, the words aren't in context so vocabulary building is limited. Words With Friends is a fun and social way to play with words, but not their meanings.\n
